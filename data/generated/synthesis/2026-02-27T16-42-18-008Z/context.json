      "extractionSummary": "This peer-reviewed paper proposes an axiomatic framework for mathematical scale theory using cyclic group theory and cyclic order relations. It formalizes scales as cyclic embeddings from a diatonic tone set into a chromatic tone set, unifying previous work on maximally even scales, well-formed scales, and Myhill's property. The paper argues that cross-cultural scale commonalities (5–7 tones, moderate interval sizes, asymmetry) arise from psychological and perceptual constraints. It establishes formal correspondences between cyclic ordered sets, generalized interval systems, and regular group actions as three equivalent viewpoints on pitch-class systems.",

The model unifies two earlier approaches: a phase model (U(1) symmetry) and a spatial deformation model (SO(2) symmetry). Tonal attraction is modeled using wave functions along the circle of fifths, with a polynomial spatial deformation function that produces excellent agreement with Krumhansl & Kessler's (1982) empirical tonal hierarchy data. The framework treats musical forces (gravity, magnetism, inertia) not as metaphors but as structurally real phenomena arising from symmetry-breaking, analogous to gauge forces in physics.",

The algorithm uses an onset-time-pair representation to reduce the pattern discovery problem to instances of the classical longest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem, achieving O(n² log n) time complexity where n is the number of notes. The approach handles distortions common in live performance transcriptions (tempo variation, timing inaccuracy) better than prior methods like SIA/SIATEC, which only tolerate sporadic note-level distortions. The paper also presents windowed variants that restrict onset-time differences for more musically meaningful results, and notes that time-scaled (as opposed to time-warped) pattern discovery remains a significantly harder open problem.",

Quarter-comma meantone, the most historically prominent variant, was dominant from the early 16th to early 18th centuries and produces pure just major thirds (5:4) by tempering each fifth by 1/4 of a syntonic comma. Twelve-tone equal temperament (12-TET) can be understood as approximately 1/11-syntonic-comma meantone, producing major thirds that are wide by about 13 cents compared to just intonation. Several equal temperament systems (19, 31, 53 TET, etc.) serve as close approximations to specific meantone variants. The whole tone in meantone systems is the geometric mean of the just major tone (9:8) and minor tone (10:9), hence the name 'meantone.'",

      "extractionSummary": "This peer-reviewed study investigates inter-annotator agreement in musical pattern annotation using two digital tools (ANOMIC and PAF) applied to six monophonic excerpts from Bach, Beethoven, Haydn, and Mozart. The research finds significant disagreement between annotators even among musical experts, with agreement varying by educational background, tool interface, and musical excerpt. Feature-based analysis across 33 musical pattern attributes reveals that tool choice and annotator background both influence which patterns are identified, with 23 of 33 features showing significant differences between the two datasets. The study highlights the fundamental problem that there is no single comprehensive definition of a musical pattern, making ground-truth annotation for algorithm evaluation inherently ambiguous. Results suggest that richer, multi-annotator datasets are needed to properly evaluate automatic pattern discovery algorithms.",

      "extractionSummary": "This peer-reviewed paper proposes rigorous mathematical foundations for music theory and composition using topos theory and presheaf categories, extending Guerino Mazzola's framework from 'The Topos of Music.' The author argues that existing mathematical music theory (including pitch-class set theory) suffers from ad-hoc constructions and implicit definitions, and proposes a unified theory of 'structure' governed by three principles: comprehensive comprehension, explicit encoding, and minimal ontological commitments. The framework uses functor categories and presheaves to encode musical phenomena—including pitch spaces, duration spaces, groups, gestures, and synthesizer parameter spaces—within a single ontological system. A key motivation is enabling the synthesis of algebraically and topologically defined musical entities (formulae and gestures) without an ontological divide between them. The paper also identifies an open problem: formulating an analog to Mazzola's denotators within the new framework.",
