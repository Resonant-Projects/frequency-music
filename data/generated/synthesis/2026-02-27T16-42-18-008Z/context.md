Summary:
This peer-reviewed paper proposes an axiomatic framework for mathematical scale theory using cyclic group theory and cyclic order relations. It formalizes scales as cyclic embeddings from a diatonic tone set into a chromatic tone set, unifying previous work on maximally even scales, well-formed scales, and Myhill's property. The paper argues that cross-cultural scale commonalities (5–7 tones, moderate interval sizes, asymmetry) arise from psychological and perceptual constraints. It establishes formal correspondences between cyclic ordered sets, generalized interval systems, and regular group actions as three equivalent viewpoints on pitch-class systems.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] The concept of a musical scale as a collection of pitch classes is universal throughout the world, and the notion of the octave and octave equivalence are found universal across cultures.
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Cross-culturally, scales typically contain between five and seven tones, with intervals between adjacent scale tones ranging between one and three semitones, and asymmetric scales being more common than symmetric ones.
- [3] [peer_reviewed] The typical number of scale tones (5–7) relates to the amount of distinct pitches that a human can reliably keep track of, a psychologically-grounded constraint.
- [4] [peer_reviewed] The prevalence of moderately small intervals between consecutive scale degrees results from constraints that large intervals are more difficult to sing and too-small intervals are hard to distinguish by the human ear.
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Scale asymmetry enables the creation of complex tonal structures by making positions in the scale easy to perceive and remember, and there is mathematically only one maximally asymmetric scale (up to isomorphism) for each given tone material and scale size.
- [6] [peer_reviewed] The diatonic C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) is a maximally even, non-symmetric scale with a trivial cyclic automorphism group, while the octatonic scale is also maximally even but has four proper rotational symmetries.
- [7] [peer_reviewed] In 12-tone equal temperament, the chromatic scale has cardinality 12, and the diatonic scale has cardinality 7; intervals between two scale tones can be measured in two ways: specific (chromatic) size and generic (diatonic) size.
- [8] [peer_reviewed] Both pitch-class collections and rhythms are formally cyclic structures, making the mathematical framework for scales directly applicable to rhythmic patterns (e.g., talas in Indian music).
- [9] [peer_reviewed] The diminished-seventh chord is totally symmetric (every tone has the same relations to all other tones), whereas the octatonic scale, despite appearing symmetric, is not totally symmetric.

Composition Parameters:
- tuningSystem: 12-tone equal temperament
- note: C major scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, B (diatonic size 7, chromatic size 12)
- harmonicProfile: Octatonic scale (half-step/whole-step diminished): 8 tones, 4-fold rotational symmetry, maximally even
- harmonicProfile: Hexatonic scale: 6 tones, 3-fold rotational symmetry, not maximally even
- harmonicProfile: Interval size range for adjacent scale degrees: 1–3 semitones (cross-cultural norm)

Open Questions:
- Can the axiomatic cyclic-order framework be extended to non-octave-equivalent tuning systems (e.g., Bohlen-Pierce) or microtonal scales?
- What psychological mechanisms specifically underlie the preference for 5–7 tone scales—is it purely working memory capacity, or are there additional auditory processing constraints?
- How do 'more sophisticated quantifications of asymmetry' beyond maximal asymmetry correlate with cross-cultural aesthetic preferences or learnability of scales?
- Can the formal equivalence between rhythmic and pitch-class cyclic structures be exploited to generate novel compositional mappings between rhythmic patterns and scales?
- To what extent does the mathematical uniqueness of the maximally asymmetric scale explain the prevalence of the diatonic scale across unrelated musical traditions?
- How does the automorphism group structure of a scale relate to perceptual ratings of tonal stability or memorability?
- Can well-formedness and Myhill's property be meaningfully defined for continuous (non-equal-tempered) pitch spaces, and what would that imply for just intonation scales?

Summary:
This paper develops a gauge-theoretic model of tonal attraction in music cognition, applying concepts from quantum field theory (specifically SU(2) gauge symmetry) to explain both static and dynamic tonal attraction. The model unifies two earlier approaches: a phase model (U(1) symmetry) and a spatial deformation model (SO(2) symmetry). Tonal attraction is modeled using wave functions along the circle of fifths, with a polynomial spatial deformation function that produces excellent agreement with Krumhansl & Kessler's (1982) empirical tonal hierarchy data. The framework treats musical forces (gravity, magnetism, inertia) not as metaphors but as structurally real phenomena arising from symmetry-breaking, analogous to gauge forces in physics.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] In Krumhansl & Kessler's (1982) probe-tone experiments, the tonic pitch received the highest tonal attraction rating, followed by the pitches completing the tonic triad (third and fifth), then the remaining scale degrees, and finally chromatic non-scale tones.
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Lerdahl's hierarchical model of tonal attraction produces predictions in excellent agreement with experimental data for major keys, but shows significant deviations for minor keys.
- [3] [peer_reviewed] The spatial deformation model using a fourth-order polynomial deformation function on the circle of fifths produces excellent agreement with static tonal attraction data from Krumhansl & Kessler (1982).
- [4] [peer_reviewed] Western tonal music in equal temperament has a fundamental transposition symmetry described by the cyclic group Z_12, generated by intervals of minor seconds (1 semitone), major sevenths (11 semitones), perfect fifths (7 semitones), and perfect fourths (5 semitones).
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Tonal hierarchies that privilege certain notes over others appear to be a near-universal feature of music across cultures, serving a cognitive function as landmarks for melodic memory and interpretation.
- [6] [peer_reviewed] Dynamic tonal attraction (harmonic resolution) cannot be fully understood without reference to static tonal attraction (tonal hierarchy); the two are interdependent.
- [7] [speculative] The tritone (at π on the circle of fifths, e.g., G♭ relative to C) receives maximal spatial deformation in the model, while the tonic receives no deformation, reflecting the tritone's maximal instability in tonal hierarchy.
- [8] [peer_reviewed] Three musical forces — gravity (tendency of notes heard as 'above a stable platform' to descend), magnetism (tendency of unstable notes to move toward the nearest stable pitch, growing stronger with proximity), and inertia (tendency of a melodic pattern to continue in the same direction) — can be modeled as conceptual metaphors structuring musical cognition.
- [9] [peer_reviewed] In the force-free case, the qubit model, scalar Schrödinger wave function model, and spinor Pauli wave function model all yield identical predictions for tonal attraction.

Composition Parameters:
- tuningSystem: Equal temperament (12-tone)
- harmonicProfile: Tonal hierarchy for C major (Lerdahl basic space)
- harmonicProfile: Circle of fifths parameterization
- chordProgression: Dynamic attraction context chords (C root)
- note: Tonic vector Ψ₀ = (1, 0) representing C in qubit Hilbert space

Open Questions:
- Can the SU(2) gauge model be extended to explain tonal attraction in non-Western tuning systems or microtonal music where Z_12 symmetry does not apply?
- Why does the Lerdahl hierarchical model perform well for major keys but show significant deviations for minor keys — and can the gauge model resolve this discrepancy?
- What is the physical or cognitive interpretation of the gauge field itself in the musical context — what does it correspond to neurologically or psychoacoustically?
- Can the spatial deformation function (4th-order polynomial) be derived from first principles or perceptual data, rather than chosen as a convenient interpolation?
- How does the model's treatment of dynamic tonal attraction scale to longer musical sequences, not just single probe tones following a chord?
- Is there empirical evidence that the 'magnetic interaction' term in the decomposed Hamiltonian corresponds to a measurable perceptual or neural phenomenon?
- How would the model handle quartal harmony, atonal music, or modal music where the tonic-dominant axis is weakened or absent?
- Does the cross-cultural universality of tonal hierarchies imply that the Z_12 cyclic group structure is a perceptual universal, or is it culturally contingent?
- Can the gauge-theoretic framework be used generatively — i.e., to compose music that maximizes or shapes tonal attraction profiles in specific ways?
- How does octave equivalence assumption (collapsing to 12 pitch classes) affect the model's accuracy, and could a model incorporating octave register improve predictions?

Summary:
This peer-reviewed paper presents a novel algorithm for discovering repeating patterns in polyphonic symbolic music under transposition and time-warp invariances. The algorithm uses an onset-time-pair representation to reduce the pattern discovery problem to instances of the classical longest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem, achieving O(n² log n) time complexity where n is the number of notes. The approach handles distortions common in live performance transcriptions (tempo variation, timing inaccuracy) better than prior methods like SIA/SIATEC, which only tolerate sporadic note-level distortions. The paper also presents windowed variants that restrict onset-time differences for more musically meaningful results, and notes that time-scaled (as opposed to time-warped) pattern discovery remains a significantly harder open problem.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Real music is almost inevitably polyphonic, meaning that a multitude of parallel tones may sound at any time, making musical pattern discovery significantly more complex than text or linear structure pattern matching.
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Identical musical patterns may appear in different keys and/or at different written tempos, and these systematic distortions can be handled by examining relative rather than absolute pitch and duration values (transposition and time-scale invariance).
- [3] [peer_reviewed] The SIA and SIATEC algorithms for maximal repeating pattern discovery under transposition and time-shifting invariances work in O(n² log n) and O(n³) time respectively, but fail to find musically meaningful repetitions in live performance transcriptions because they cannot tolerate systematic tempo variation.
- [4] [peer_reviewed] The new repeating pattern discovery algorithm under transposition and time-warp invariances works in O(n² log n) time and is more suitable for live performance transcriptions where tempo varies and onset times are rarely accurate.
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Finding time-scaled repetitions (where the ratio of corresponding durations is a constant α) is significantly harder algorithmically than finding time-warped repetitions; the best known algorithms for the time-scaled pattern matching problem require quadratic time, and no efficient algorithm exists for time-scaled repeating pattern discovery.
- [6] [peer_reviewed] Allowing stronger invariances in pattern matching algorithms increases the risk of false-positive repetitions, necessitating a post-processing phase to discard extraneous matches.
- [7] [peer_reviewed] A geometric piano-roll representation of music, where each note is a 2D point with onset time on the x-axis and pitch on the y-axis, supports transposition and time-shift invariance and provides a useful foundation for polyphonic pattern matching algorithms.
- [8] [peer_reviewed] The paper uses Western equal-tempered polyphonic music as its domain, and by working in the symbolic music domain it explicitly avoids the hard problem of fundamental frequency estimation from polyphonic audio.

Composition Parameters:
- tuningSystem: Western equal temperament

Open Questions:
- Can an efficient (sub-quadratic) algorithm be developed for time-scaled repeating pattern discovery in polyphonic music, given that the current best approaches require quadratic time?
- How can musically interesting patterns be automatically filtered from the large set of mathematically valid repeating patterns detected by time-warped algorithms?
- Is there a time-warped equivalent of the SIATEC algorithm that finds all occurrences of each discovered maximal pattern (without relying on translation vectors)?
- How well does the geometric point-set / onset-time-pair representation transfer to audio-domain polyphonic music when combined with fundamental frequency estimation?
- What window parameters (w, d) are musically optimal for different genres or performance styles when using the windowed variant of the algorithm?
- Can the algorithm be extended to handle harmonic/timbral features beyond pitch and onset time, enabling richer invariance combinations?
- How does performance scale in practice for very large musical datasets (e.g., full orchestral scores with thousands of simultaneous notes)?
- Could this framework be applied to non-Western tuning systems, or does the equal-temperament assumption limit its applicability?

Summary:
Meantone temperaments are tuning systems built from sequences of tempered fifths (slightly narrower than the just 3:2 ratio) designed to bring major or minor thirds closer to just intonation ratios of 5:4 or 6:5 respectively. Quarter-comma meantone, the most historically prominent variant, was dominant from the early 16th to early 18th centuries and produces pure just major thirds (5:4) by tempering each fifth by 1/4 of a syntonic comma. Twelve-tone equal temperament (12-TET) can be understood as approximately 1/11-syntonic-comma meantone, producing major thirds that are wide by about 13 cents compared to just intonation. Several equal temperament systems (19, 31, 53 TET, etc.) serve as close approximations to specific meantone variants. The whole tone in meantone systems is the geometric mean of the just major tone (9:8) and minor tone (10:9), hence the name 'meantone.'

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] A perfect fifth in just intonation has a frequency ratio of exactly 3:2.
- [2] [peer_reviewed] A just major third has a frequency ratio of 5:4 and a just minor third has a ratio of 6:5.
- [3] [peer_reviewed] In 12-TET, each semitone equals one-twelfth of an octave, with frequency ratio 2^(1/12):1, and the perfect fifth has ratio 2^(7/12):1.
- [4] [peer_reviewed] 12-TET narrows the perfect fifth by approximately 2 cents (1/12 of a Pythagorean comma) relative to Pythagorean tuning, and produces major thirds that are wide by about 13 cents relative to the just 5:4 ratio.
- [5] [peer_reviewed] 12-TET is almost exactly equivalent to 1/11-syntonic-comma meantone tuning, with a fifth tempering of 1.955 cents vs. 1.95512 cents.
- [6] [peer_reviewed] In quarter-comma meantone, four ascending tempered fifths (C–G–D–A–E) produce a just major third C–E with ratio 5:4, which is one syntonic comma (~22 cents) narrower than the Pythagorean major third.
- [7] [peer_reviewed] The syntonic comma is the ratio 81/80, representing the difference between the Pythagorean major third (81/64) and the just major third (5/4).
- [8] [peer_reviewed] Quarter-comma meantone has a residual gap (diesis) between F# and Gb of 125/128, or approximately −41.06 cents — nearly twice the size of the Pythagorean comma and in the opposite direction.
- [9] [peer_reviewed] In third-comma meantone, three descending tempered fifths produce a just minor third of ratio 6:5, and this system is closely approximated by 19-TET.
- [10] [peer_reviewed] The quarter-comma meantone whole tone is the geometric mean of the just major tone (9:8) and just minor tone (10:9), equal to √(5/4) ≈ 1.11803, or approximately 193.157 cents.
- [11] [peer_reviewed] Quarter-comma meantone can be closely approximated by 31-TET, which closes the spiral of fifths into a circle.
- [12] [peer_reviewed] 53-TET almost perfectly approximates both Pythagorean tuning and 5-limit just intonation.
- [13] [peer_reviewed] A whole number of just perfect fifths can never sum to a whole number of octaves, because log₂(3) is irrational.
- [14] [speculative] Wolf intervals in keyboard instruments are artifacts of using insufficient keys rather than inherent properties of the tuning system itself.
- [15] [anecdotal] Quarter-comma meantone was in common use from the early 16th century until the early 18th century, after which 12-TET came into general use; it persisted for church organs well into the 19th century.
- [16] [anecdotal] A tuner can achieve quarter-comma meantone by ear near middle C (~264 Hz) by listening for beats at approximately 1 Hz when comparing a reference perfect fifth to the tempered note.
- [17] [peer_reviewed] For a tuning to qualify as meantone, its fifth must be between 685+5/7 cents and 700 cents in size.
- [18] [peer_reviewed] Historically used meantone temperaments occupy a narrow range of fifth sizes, approximately 695 to 699 cents.
- [19] [speculative] Tempering the partials of synthesizer tones to match non-12-TET tunings can restore harmonic coherence in tuning systems far from quarter-comma meantone.

- tuningSystem: Third-comma meantone
- tuningSystem: 12-TET (Twelve-tone equal temperament)
- tuningSystem: Pythagorean tuning
- tuningSystem: 31-TET
- tuningSystem: 19-TET
- tuningSystem: 53-TET
- frequency: Middle C ≈ 264 Hz
- harmonicProfile: Syntonic comma = 81/80 ≈ 21.506 cents
- harmonicProfile: Quarter-comma meantone diesis (wolf gap) = 125/128 ≈ −41.06 cents
- harmonicProfile: Quarter-comma meantone whole tone = √(5/4) ≈ 193.157 cents
- harmonicProfile: Just major tone = 9:8 (≈ 203.91 cents), just minor tone = 10:9 (≈ 182.40 cents)

Open Questions:
- How perceptible is the 13-cent wide major third in 12-TET to trained vs. untrained listeners, and does context (harmonic vs. melodic) affect this perception?
- What are the compositional implications of using 31-TET (near-perfect quarter-comma meantone) for contemporary music, given its availability on electronic instruments?
- How does partial tempering on synthesizers (matching overtone series to non-12-TET tunings) affect timbral perception and psychoacoustic consonance?
- Can the historical ear-tuning method (listening for ~1 Hz beats near middle C at ~264 Hz) be reliably taught and reproduced today, and how does it compare in accuracy to electronic tuning?
- What is the perceptual threshold at which the wolf interval (−41 cents in quarter-comma meantone) becomes unacceptable in different musical contexts?
- Why did 12-TET prevail over meantone in the early 18th century despite meantone's superior thirds — was it primarily practical (keyboard design, modulation needs) or aesthetic?
- How do composers like Ligeti and Adams who specifically demand meantone in their scores integrate the tuning system into their harmonic language?
- Is there a psychoacoustic advantage to tuning systems where the whole tone is the exact geometric mean of the major and minor tones, or is this purely a mathematical elegance?
- How closely does 53-TET approximate 7-limit and 11-limit just intervals beyond the 5-limit, making it potentially useful for extended just intonation work?

Summary:
This peer-reviewed study investigates inter-annotator agreement in musical pattern annotation using two digital tools (ANOMIC and PAF) applied to six monophonic excerpts from Bach, Beethoven, Haydn, and Mozart. The research finds significant disagreement between annotators even among musical experts, with agreement varying by educational background, tool interface, and musical excerpt. Feature-based analysis across 33 musical pattern attributes reveals that tool choice and annotator background both influence which patterns are identified, with 23 of 33 features showing significant differences between the two datasets. The study highlights the fundamental problem that there is no single comprehensive definition of a musical pattern, making ground-truth annotation for algorithm evaluation inherently ambiguous. Results suggest that richer, multi-annotator datasets are needed to properly evaluate automatic pattern discovery algorithms.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] There is no clear single comprehensive definition of what constitutes a musical pattern or even repetition, making single-reference annotations problematic for algorithm evaluation.
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Not all recurring sequences are perceived as patterns by listeners; perception depends on the structural position of the pattern, the listener's moment-to-moment perception, and the listener's musical background or music-theoretic education.
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Inter-annotator agreement for musical pattern annotations is generally low, with ANOMIC musician annotators averaging an F-score of 0.61 and non-musicians averaging 0.63 at a 5-crotchet threshold, dropping to 0.47 and 0.38 respectively at a 1-crotchet threshold.
- [4] [peer_reviewed] Annotators from different musical study programmes (musicology, music theory/composition, music pedagogy) show different inter-annotator agreement patterns, suggesting that academic music training background influences pattern perception.
- [5] [peer_reviewed] The choice of music visualization interface (piano roll vs. sheet music) influences the musical patterns that annotators identify, with 23 out of 33 pattern features showing significant differences between the two tools.
- [6] [peer_reviewed] A musical pattern can be defined as 'a salient recurring figure or short musical idea of special importance,' while the MIREX task operationally defines patterns as 'a set of ontime-pitch pairs that occur at least twice in a piece of music.'
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Inter-annotator agreement for chord annotations between musical experts is low, analogous to the low agreement found in melodic pattern annotation.
- [8] [peer_reviewed] The first occurrence of a pattern in a musical piece tends to have a more significant structural role than subsequent occurrences.

Composition Parameters:
- rhythm: Crotchet (quarter note) as unit of temporal measurement for pattern boundaries
- instrument: Horn, Soprano voice, Violin I (monophonic melodic lines)
- note: Pattern features include: duration (in crotchets), note range, pitch direction changes, intervallic leaps, root notes, last note duration, occurrences

Open Questions:
- How do dynamic or adaptive time-resolution thresholds affect inter-annotator agreement scores compared to fixed crotchet thresholds?
- Can more sophisticated musical expertise indices (beyond simple 1-10 scoring) better predict annotation behavior and inter-annotator agreement?
- To what extent does listening to music (vs. reading notation only) during annotation change which patterns are identified?
- How can rich multi-annotator datasets be transformed into valid reference data for evaluating automatic pattern discovery algorithms without privileging any single annotator's perspective?
- Do cross-cultural or cross-stylistic differences in music theory training produce systematic differences in pattern perception beyond what was observed between study programmes?
- What is the relationship between perceptually salient patterns and computationally discovered patterns, and how should algorithm evaluation weight these differently?
- How does the automatic occurrence matching function in ANOMIC (for exact repetitions and chromatic transpositions) influence the types of patterns annotators identify compared to manual annotation?
- Would extending the study to polyphonic music significantly change inter-annotator agreement dynamics, given that monophonic melody already shows substantial disagreement?
- Is there a minimum number of annotators needed to derive stable, representative ground truth for musical pattern evaluation?
- How does pattern duration distribution differ systematically between expert and non-expert annotators across different musical styles?

Summary:
A study published in Current Biology reveals that horse whinnies consist of two simultaneously produced sounds: low-frequency vocal fold vibrations (~200 Hz) and high-frequency laryngeal whistles (>1,000 Hz). Researchers confirmed this dual mechanism by blowing helium through excised horse larynxes — helium raised the pitch of the whistle (which depends on airstream turbulence and sound speed) while leaving the vocal fold vibration frequency unchanged. Horses are the first large mammal known to produce laryngeal whistles, and the only animal known to combine them simultaneously with vocal fold vibrations. The two frequency components are hypothesized to convey distinct emotional messages, suggesting the whinny evolved as a multi-channel communication signal.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Horse whinnies contain two simultaneously produced sounds: low-frequency vocal fold vibrations at approximately 200 Hz and high-frequency laryngeal whistles exceeding 1,000 Hz.
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Laryngeal whistles are produced by turbulent airstreams moving through the larynx, and their pitch is dependent on the speed of sound in the medium — unlike vocal fold vibration, whose frequency is independent of the medium.
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Horses are the first large mammal known to produce laryngeal whistles, and the only animal known to produce them simultaneously with vocal fold vibration sounds.
- [4] [peer_reviewed] The two frequency components of a horse whinny convey distinct emotional information and are hypothesized to have evolved for simultaneous communication of multiple messages.
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Vocal fold vibration in horses and humans share the same basic mechanism: folded vocal cords vibrate as air passes through them.

Composition Parameters:
- frequency: ~200 Hz
- frequency: >1,000 Hz

Open Questions:
- What is the precise frequency range of horse laryngeal whistles, and how does it vary by individual horse, breed, or emotional state?
- Could the dual-mechanism vocalization in horses inspire new approaches to electronic or synthesized sound design — e.g., layering turbulence-based noise with tonal oscillators?
- Are there musical traditions or instruments that independently discovered the combination of turbulent-airstream tones with vibrating-membrane tones, analogous to the horse whinny?
- How does the pitch of a laryngeal whistle scale with airflow speed and larynx geometry — is there a physical model applicable to instrument design?
- Do the two frequency components of the whinny maintain a fixed or variable harmonic relationship, and if so, does that relationship encode information?
- Could the helium-shift experiment be applied to human singers or wind instrument players to isolate distinct resonance modes in their vocal tracts?
- What specific emotional states map to which frequency component (low vs. high), and could this inform how composers use frequency register to signal emotional content?

Summary:
This peer-reviewed paper proposes rigorous mathematical foundations for music theory and composition using topos theory and presheaf categories, extending Guerino Mazzola's framework from 'The Topos of Music.' The author argues that existing mathematical music theory (including pitch-class set theory) suffers from ad-hoc constructions and implicit definitions, and proposes a unified theory of 'structure' governed by three principles: comprehensive comprehension, explicit encoding, and minimal ontological commitments. The framework uses functor categories and presheaves to encode musical phenomena—including pitch spaces, duration spaces, groups, gestures, and synthesizer parameter spaces—within a single ontological system. A key motivation is enabling the synthesis of algebraically and topologically defined musical entities (formulae and gestures) without an ontological divide between them. The paper also identifies an open problem: formulating an analog to Mazzola's denotators within the new framework.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Pitch-class set theory, despite being a mathematical approach, relies on intuitive notions of sets and assembles advanced constructions in an ad-hoc manner, lacking rigorous mathematical foundations.
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Classifying chords using group-theoretic invariance (transposition, inversion) provides a more scientifically agreeable and systematic basis than subjective criteria such as 'dissonant,' 'consonant,' or 'pretty.'
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Forte's pitch-class set theory posits ordered and unordered sets as fundamentally distinct ontological categories declared 'by fiat' rather than deriving them systematically from a foundational framework, which is epistemologically problematic.
- [4] [speculative] A unified mathematical ontology for music theory enables comparison and synthesis of diverse musical objects—from twelve-tone serial works to Gagaku music—without requiring alterations to the foundational system.
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Mazzola's algebraic (module-presheaf) and topological (gesture) frameworks represent an ontological divide between 'formulaic' and 'gestural' musical realities, which this paper proposes to overcome through a unified structure theory.
- [6] [peer_reviewed] Product structures in a presheaf category can encode the Cartesian product of musically distinct parameter spaces (e.g., pitch space and duration space), yielding composite structures with pitch-duration pairs.
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Function structures in a presheaf category can encode sequences of group elements indexed by a totally ordered set, which is musically interpretable as an ordered sequence of harmonic objects.
- [8] [peer_reviewed] Topos theory provides a unified and systematic approach to encoding musical phenomena, offering a rigorous foundation that supports product, coproduct, power, and function operations on musical structures.

Composition Parameters:
- note: Pitch-class sets (unordered collections of pitch classes mod 12)
- tuningSystem: Twelve-tone equal temperament (implicit, via pitch-class set theory)

Open Questions:
- Can an analog to Mazzola's denotator formalism be rigorously formulated within the proposed presheaf-based structure theory framework?
- Once a denotator analog is established, how can local and global compositions be classified within the new framework?
- How does the proposed structure theory framework handle continuous (analog) musical parameters—such as microtonal pitch or continuous timbre—compared to the discrete pitch-class set approach?
- Can the unified algebraic-topological framework actually dissolve the formulaic/gestural ontological divide in compositional practice, or does the distinction re-emerge at a higher level?
- What are the practical compositional implications of using power structures (analogous to powersets of substructures) to enumerate all substructures of a given musical space?
- How does this framework compare to other category-theoretic approaches to music (e.g., Popoff, Andreatta, and Ehresmann 2018) in terms of expressive power for specific harmonic or rhythmic phenomena?
- Is there a risk that minimizing ontological commitments in a maximally general framework sacrifices perceptually or culturally meaningful distinctions that ad-hoc models naturally capture?
- Can this framework encode continuous acoustic/physical phenomena (e.g., waveforms, spectral content, psychoacoustic perception) or is it limited to discrete symbolic music-theoretic objects?

Summary:
A voice memo from Keith outlining his core research vision: exploring connections between music frequencies, emotional resonance, physical matter, light frequencies, and mathematics of harmonic frequencies of the Earth. He envisions creating music and healing modalities by combining these domains, drawing on Jack Cruz's work on frequency/health and Misati's exponential intelligence framework. He also proposes using functional programming as an analogy for understanding frequency patterns and programs.

Claims:
- [1] [personal] Music frequency, emotional frequency, matter frequency, and light frequency are interconnected and can be combined for healing and upliftment
- [2] [speculative] Frequency patterns and programs can be understood through functional programming analogies

Composition Parameters:
- frequency: Earth harmonic frequencies
- tuningSystem: Frequency-emotion mapping
- harmonicProfile: Light-sound frequency correspondence

Open Questions:
- What rigorous evidence exists for specific frequency-emotion correspondences beyond cultural association?
- How exactly do Schumann resonances interact with biological systems, and is this compositionally useful?
- Can the functional programming analogy be formalized — what are the 'functions' and 'data types' of frequency patterns?
- What is the precise mathematical relationship between audible and light frequency octaves?
