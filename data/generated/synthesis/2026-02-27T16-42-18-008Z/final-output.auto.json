    "question": "How does harmonic profile strategy influence perceived consonance, roughness, and continuity in a controlled harmonic micro-study?",
    "hypothesis": "If we render one identical arrangement with harmonic profile strategy while holding all other musical factors fixed, then listener ratings will show a consistent ordering in perceived consonance, roughness, and continuity between versions, because this variable changes tension-release contour and perceptual expectation without introducing mix or instrumentation confounds.",
    "rationaleMd": "Selected sources span acoustic mechanisms (ratio, periodicity, temperament) and structural/cognitive mechanisms (harmonic topology, pitch-space organization, historical usage), allowing non-tuning and tuning variables to be compared under one protocol [S1, S2, S3].\n\nThe selected evidence supports manipulating harmonic profile strategy while keeping tuning fixed as a control, so broader musical and perceptual hypotheses can be tested without collapsing to temperament-only framing [S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6].\n\nFalsification criterion: if blinded ratings show no stable ordering across versions in perceived consonance, roughness, and continuity, or if annotations fail to cluster by condition, the hypothesis is not supported.",
