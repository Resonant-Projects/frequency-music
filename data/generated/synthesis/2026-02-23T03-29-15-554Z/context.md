Summary:
Meantone temperaments are musical tuning systems that use slightly flattened fifths to produce purer major and minor thirds compared to Pythagorean tuning. Quarter-comma meantone was the dominant keyboard tuning from the early 16th to early 18th centuries, producing perfect 5:4 major thirds by tempering fifths by 1/4 of a syntonic comma. These systems create wolf intervals when confined to 12-note keyboards, but can be approximated by various equal temperament divisions like 31-TET for quarter-comma meantone.

- [4] [peer_reviewed] 12-tone equal temperament narrows perfect fifths by about 2 cents or 1/12 of a Pythagorean comma
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Meantone temperament was commonly used from early 16th century till early 18th century
- [6] [peer_reviewed] 31-TET closely approximates quarter-comma meantone temperament
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Quarter-comma meantone creates a residual gap of 125/128 ratio or -41.06 cents between F# and Gb

Summary:
Equal temperament is a tuning system that divides the octave into equal steps, with 12-tone equal temperament (12 TET) being the dominant Western system since the 18th century. The mathematical foundation involves dividing the octave by the 12th root of 2 (≈1.059463), creating semitones of 100 cents each. While 12 TET approximates just intervals reasonably well, it introduces small tuning errors, with thirds being the most affected intervals.

- [2] [peer_reviewed] In 12 TET, the frequency ratio between adjacent semitones is the 12th root of 2, approximately 1.059463
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Zhu Zaiyu (1584) and Simon Stevin (1585) are credited with the mathematical calculation of equal temperament
- [4] [peer_reviewed] 12 TET produces tuning errors compared to just intonation, with major thirds being 13.69 cents sharp and minor thirds being 15.64 cents flat
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Perfect fifths and fourths in 12 TET are very close to just intervals, with only 1.96 cents of error
- [6] [peer_reviewed] String instruments tuned in perfect fifths (violins, violas, cellos) use a semitone ratio of approximately 100.28 cents, slightly different from 12 TET
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Unfretted string ensembles and vocal groups sometimes use tuning closer to just intonation for acoustic reasons

Summary:
This is a comprehensive scientific examination of music theory, covering the physics of sound production in musical instruments, various tuning systems (just intonation, equal temperament, Pythagorean), and psychoacoustic principles of human sound perception. The work systematically explains how vibrating strings produce overtones, how different tuning systems create frequency ratios between musical notes, and how instruments generate sound through various physical mechanisms. It bridges the gap between the mathematical/physical foundations of music and the artistic experience.

- [2] [peer_reviewed] The speed of sound in air is approximately 340 meters per second under standard atmospheric conditions and is independent of frequency and intensity within a wide range
- [3] [peer_reviewed] High frequency components of sound decay faster with distance than low frequency components due to absorption coefficient being proportional to frequency squared
- [4] [peer_reviewed] The octave represents a 2:1 frequency ratio, discovered by Pythagoras around 500 BC
- [5] [peer_reviewed] In just intonation, the perfect fifth has a frequency ratio of 3:2, the perfect fourth 4:3, and the major third 5:4
- [6] [peer_reviewed] Equal temperament divides the octave into 12 equal semitones, each with a frequency ratio of 2^(1/12) ≈ 1.059463
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Human perception of musical note pitch is primarily determined by fundamental frequency, with lesser influence from intensity and harmonic content
- [8] [peer_reviewed] The phase of harmonic overtones does not affect human perception of sound quality, despite affecting the waveform
- [9] [anecdotal] Music appears to serve no obvious adaptive purpose, with Darwin noting it has no direct use in ordinary life habits

Summary:
Kyle Gann explains just intonation tuning, where pitches are defined as frequency ratios (like 3/2 for a perfect fifth) rather than equal temperament's 12 equal divisions. He argues that equal temperament, while allowing easy transposition, creates buzzy, less pure intervals compared to the mathematically simple ratios of just intonation. The article provides detailed examples of various tuning systems and claims that just intonation creates more meditative, introspective music while equal temperament promotes nervous energy and action.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] A 2-to-1 frequency ratio creates an octave interval
- [2] [peer_reviewed] A 3/2 frequency ratio produces a perfect fifth interval
- [3] [peer_reviewed] A 5/4 frequency ratio produces a major third interval

- [6] [anecdotal] Equal temperament creates audible beating between sustained pitches
- [7] [speculative] Equal temperament tuning is responsible for cultural psychology favoring progress and action over introspection
- [8] [personal] Just intonation makes music sound more meditative while equal temperament creates nervous energy
- [9] [peer_reviewed] In just intonation, to add intervals you multiply their ratios

Summary:
This academic paper explores the physics behind modern music, particularly focusing on how guitar amplifier distortion creates new musical notes not played by the musician. The authors examine the harmonic series, tuning systems, and why equal temperament tuning is mathematically imperfect but practically necessary. They demonstrate how nonlinear amplification generates additional frequencies through trigonometric principles and explain why some distorted chords create the perception of low notes that aren't actually present.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] When a musical note is played on an instrument, it vibrates not just at the fundamental frequency but also at integer multiples of that frequency (harmonics), producing overtones at 2x, 3x, 4x the fundamental frequency
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Consonant chords are composed of notes with the most overlap between their overtone series
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Equal temperament tuning is mathematically always out of tune because it uses irrational frequency ratios instead of the rational ratios found in natural harmonics
- [4] [peer_reviewed] Distorted guitar amplifiers create new musical notes that are not played by the musician through nonlinear amplification
- [5] [peer_reviewed] The 12-note Western musical scale is mathematically derived from the perfect fifth interval (3:2 frequency ratio) through Pythagorean tuning
- [6] [speculative] Standard guitar tuners using equal temperament are incompatible with good sounding music when amplifier distortion is involved

- frequency: 220 Hz
- frequency: 440 Hz
- frequency: 261.6 Hz
- tuningSystem: Equal Temperament
- tuningSystem: Pythagorean Tuning
- harmonicProfile: Perfect Fifth

- harmonicProfile: Perfect Fourth

Open Questions:
- How exactly do the trigonometric identities create new frequencies in distorted amplifiers?

- How do humans perceive phantom fundamental frequencies in highly distorted chords?
- What is the optimal balance between mathematical perfection and practical usability in tuning systems?
