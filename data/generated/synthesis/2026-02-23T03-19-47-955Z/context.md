Summary:
Meantone temperaments are musical tuning systems that use slightly flattened fifths to produce purer major and minor thirds compared to Pythagorean tuning. Quarter-comma meantone was the dominant keyboard tuning from the early 16th to early 18th centuries, producing perfect 5:4 major thirds by tempering fifths by 1/4 of a syntonic comma. These systems create wolf intervals when confined to 12-note keyboards, but can be approximated by various equal temperament divisions like 31-TET for quarter-comma meantone.

Summary:
Equal temperament is a tuning system that divides the octave into equal steps, with 12-tone equal temperament (12 TET) being the dominant Western system since the 18th century. The mathematical foundation involves dividing the octave by the 12th root of 2 (≈1.059463), creating semitones of 100 cents each. While 12 TET approximates just intervals reasonably well, it introduces small tuning errors, with thirds being the most affected intervals.

- [2] [peer_reviewed] In 12 TET, the frequency ratio between adjacent semitones is the 12th root of 2, approximately 1.059463
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Zhu Zaiyu (1584) and Simon Stevin (1585) are credited with the mathematical calculation of equal temperament
- [4] [peer_reviewed] 12 TET produces tuning errors compared to just intonation, with major thirds being 13.69 cents sharp and minor thirds being 15.64 cents flat
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Perfect fifths and fourths in 12 TET are very close to just intervals, with only 1.96 cents of error
- [6] [peer_reviewed] String instruments tuned in perfect fifths (violins, violas, cellos) use a semitone ratio of approximately 100.28 cents, slightly different from 12 TET
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Unfretted string ensembles and vocal groups sometimes use tuning closer to just intonation for acoustic reasons

Summary:
This is a comprehensive scientific examination of music theory, covering the physics of sound production in musical instruments, various tuning systems (just intonation, equal temperament, Pythagorean), and psychoacoustic principles of human sound perception. The work systematically explains how vibrating strings produce overtones, how different tuning systems create frequency ratios between musical notes, and how instruments generate sound through various physical mechanisms.

- [2] [peer_reviewed] The speed of sound in air is approximately 340 meters per second under standard atmospheric conditions and is independent of frequency and intensity within a wide range
- [3] [peer_reviewed] High frequency components of sound decay faster with distance than low frequency components due to absorption coefficient being proportional to frequency squared
- [4] [peer_reviewed] The octave represents a 2:1 frequency ratio, discovered by Pythagoras around 500 BC
- [5] [peer_reviewed] In just intonation, the perfect fifth has a frequency ratio of 3:2, the perfect fourth 4:3, and the major third 5:4
- [6] [peer_reviewed] Equal temperament divides the octave into 12 equal semitones, each with a frequency ratio of 2^(1/12) ≈ 1.059463
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Human perception of musical note pitch is primarily determined by fundamental frequency, with lesser influence from intensity and harmonic content
- [8] [peer_reviewed] The phase of harmonic overtones does not affect human perception of sound quality, despite affecting the waveform

Summary:
Kyle Gann explains just intonation tuning, where pitches are defined as frequency ratios (like 3/2 for a perfect fifth) rather than equal temperament's 12 equal divisions. He argues that equal temperament, while allowing easy transposition, creates buzzy, less pure intervals compared to the mathematically simple ratios of just intonation. The article provides detailed examples of various tuning systems and claims that just intonation creates more meditative, introspective music while equal temperament promotes nervous energy and action.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] A 2-to-1 frequency ratio creates an octave interval
- [2] [peer_reviewed] A 3/2 frequency ratio produces a perfect fifth interval
- [3] [peer_reviewed] A 5/4 frequency ratio produces a major third interval

Summary:
This academic paper explores the physics behind modern music, particularly focusing on how guitar amplifier distortion creates new musical notes not played by the musician. The authors examine the harmonic series, tuning systems, and why equal temperament tuning is mathematically imperfect but practically necessary. They demonstrate how nonlinear amplification generates additional frequencies through trigonometric principles and explain why some distorted chords create the perception of low notes that aren't actually present.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] When a musical note is played on an instrument, it vibrates not just at the fundamental frequency but also at integer multiples of that frequency (harmonics), producing overtones at 2x, 3x, 4x the fundamental frequency
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Consonant chords are composed of notes with the most overlap between their overtone series
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Equal temperament tuning is mathematically always out of tune because it uses irrational frequency ratios instead of the rational ratios found in natural harmonics
- [4] [peer_reviewed] Distorted guitar amplifiers create new musical notes that are not played by the musician through nonlinear amplification
- [5] [peer_reviewed] The 12-note Western musical scale is mathematically derived from the perfect fifth interval (3:2 frequency ratio) through Pythagorean tuning
- [6] [speculative] Standard guitar tuners using equal temperament are incompatible with good sounding music when amplifier distortion is involved

Summary:
This paper presents a dynamically adapting tuning scheme for just intonation that solves a system of linear equations rather than making procedural decisions about chord tuning. The method models intervals as a resistor network where each interval prefers its just ratio, automatically finding tempered compromises when perfect just intonation isn't possible. The authors implement this as open-source software and address both vertical tuning (within chords) and horizontal tuning (between successive chords) using intonational memory.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Consonance is caused by the circumstance that oscillators emit not only their fundamental frequency but also overtones with integer multiples, and consonance occurs when the m-th partial of one tone matches the n-th partial of another (mf = nf')
- [2] [peer_reviewed] The Pythagorean comma represents a 1.4% difference (23.46 cents) when stacking twelve just fifths compared to seven octaves
- [3] [peer_reviewed] The syntonic comma is 21.51 cents and represents the difference between four just fifths transposed back by two octaves and a major third of 5/4
- [4] [peer_reviewed] The equally tempered minor third is almost 16 cents smaller than the natural frequency ratio 6:5, while the major third is about 14 cents greater than the ratio 5:4
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Psychoacoustic intonational short-term memory has a typical time scale of about three seconds
- [6] [peer_reviewed] Humans can recognize intonation of sequentially played tones if the elapsed time between them is not too large

Composition Parameters:
- frequency: 440 Hz
- tuningSystem: 5-limit just intonation
- frequency: 110 Hz
- frequency: 165 Hz

Open Questions:
- How does the choice of weight factors in the resistor network model affect the perceived quality of the tuning compromise?
- What is the optimal balance between vertical tuning accuracy and horizontal tuning continuity?
- How do different musical styles and harmonic complexities affect the performance of adaptive tuning schemes?
- Can the three-second intonational memory timeframe be extended or optimized through training?
- How does this mathematical approach compare perceptually to intuitive musician adjustments in ensemble playing?

Summary:
This is a comprehensive mathematical textbook on music theory and acoustics by Dave Benson from the University of Aberdeen. The book explores the mathematical foundations of music, from basic wave theory and Fourier analysis to scales, temperaments, and digital synthesis. It emphasizes the physical basis of consonance and dissonance, explaining how the harmonic content of musical instruments determines what sounds pleasant, and traces the development of Western musical scales through various tuning systems.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Air molecules at room temperature move at mean velocities of 450-500 meters per second (over 1000 mph) with collision frequencies of approximately 10^10 collisions per second
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Sound travels through air at approximately 340 meters per second (760 mph) as longitudinal pressure waves, not through molecular movement in the direction of propagation
- [3] [peer_reviewed] For pure sine waves, the ear detects nothing special about frequencies exactly an octave apart, and consonance depends on the harmonic content produced by musical instruments rather than simple frequency ratios
- [4] [peer_reviewed] The human ear acts as a harmonic analyzer because the basilar membrane follows simple harmonic motion equations, with different points resonating at different frequencies
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Percussive instruments like those in Indonesian gamelan do not produce exact integer multiples of a fundamental frequency, making Western scales inappropriate for such music
- [6] [peer_reviewed] The auditory canal (meatus) is approximately 2.7 cm long and 0.7 cm in diameter

Composition Parameters:
- frequency: 340 m/s

Open Questions:
- How do different cultural backgrounds affect perception of consonance and dissonance?
- What mathematical models best describe the transition between different temperament systems?
- How might alternative instrument designs based on non-harmonic spectra influence scale development?
- What are the limits of the ear's frequency resolution and how do they affect musical perception?
- How do the mathematical properties of different synthesis methods relate to perceptual qualities of timbre?
