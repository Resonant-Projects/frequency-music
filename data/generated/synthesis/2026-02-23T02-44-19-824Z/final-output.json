    "question": "Do small temperament offsets (equal temperament and quarter-comma meantone) increase perceived tension versus pure just-intonation ratios in slow sustained triads?",
    "hypothesis": "If the same sustained triadic progression is rendered in (A) 5-limit just intonation, (B) quarter-comma meantone, and (C) 12-tone equal temperament, then listeners will rate A as most calm/stable, B as intermediate, and C as most tense/shimmering, because progressively tempered intervals introduce larger ratio deviations and beating relative to simple harmonic relationships.",
    "rationaleMd": "Across the selected sources, consonance is repeatedly tied to simple frequency ratios and overtone alignment (S3, S4, S5). The interval references and temperament material quantify the exact offset sizes involved when moving from pure intervals toward tempered systems, including syntonic and Pythagorean comma behavior (S1, S6). Equal temperament distributes error across all intervals and is mathematically defined by equal semitone ratios, while meantone trades purity differently across fifths/thirds (S1, S2). This supports a direct perceptual test where only tuning system varies while harmony, rhythm, instrumentation, and dynamics remain fixed (S1, S2, S4, S5).",

For each, rate 0-10:\n- perceived calm/stability\n- perceived tension/shimmer\n- meditative suitability\n\nCollect at least 2 listening contexts (headphones + monitors).\n\n## Expected Pattern\nBased on ratio-consonance and temperament evidence, expect A > B > C on calmness, with inverse ordering for tension/shimmer [S1, S2, S4, S5, S6].",
