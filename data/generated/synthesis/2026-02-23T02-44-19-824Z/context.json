      "extractionSummary": "Meantone temperaments are musical tuning systems that use slightly flattened fifths to produce purer major and minor thirds compared to Pythagorean tuning. Quarter-comma meantone was the dominant keyboard tuning from the early 16th to early 18th centuries, producing perfect 5:4 major thirds by tempering fifths by 1/4 of a syntonic comma. These systems create wolf intervals when confined to 12-note keyboards, but can be approximated by various equal temperament divisions like 31-TET for quarter-comma meantone.",

      "extractionSummary": "This is a comprehensive scientific examination of music theory, covering the physics of sound production in musical instruments, various tuning systems (just intonation, equal temperament, Pythagorean), and psychoacoustic principles of human sound perception. The work systematically explains how vibrating strings produce overtones, how different tuning systems create frequency ratios between musical notes, and how instruments generate sound through various physical mechanisms. It bridges the gap between the mathematical/physical foundations of music and the artistic experience.",

He argues that equal temperament, while allowing easy transposition, creates buzzy, less pure intervals compared to the mathematically simple ratios of just intonation. The article provides detailed examples of various tuning systems and claims that just intonation creates more meditative, introspective music while equal temperament promotes nervous energy and action.",

      "extractionSummary": "This academic paper explores the physics behind modern music, particularly focusing on how guitar amplifier distortion creates new musical notes not played by the musician. The authors examine the harmonic series, tuning systems, and why equal temperament tuning is mathematically imperfect but practically necessary. They demonstrate how nonlinear amplification generates additional frequencies through trigonometric principles and explain why some distorted chords create the perception of low notes that aren't actually present.",
