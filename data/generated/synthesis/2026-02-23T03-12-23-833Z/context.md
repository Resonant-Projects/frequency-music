Summary:
Meantone temperaments are musical tuning systems that use slightly flattened fifths to produce purer major and minor thirds compared to Pythagorean tuning. Quarter-comma meantone was the dominant keyboard tuning from the early 16th to early 18th centuries, producing perfect 5:4 major thirds by tempering fifths by 1/4 of a syntonic comma. These systems create wolf intervals when confined to 12-note keyboards, but can be approximated by various equal temperament divisions like 31-TET for quarter-comma meantone.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Perfect fifths in just intonation have a frequency ratio of 3:2
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Quarter-comma meantone produces just major thirds with a 5:4 ratio
- [3] [peer_reviewed] In quarter-comma meantone, the whole tone is the geometric mean of the major tone (9:8) and minor tone (10:9)
- [4] [peer_reviewed] 12-tone equal temperament narrows perfect fifths by about 2 cents or 1/12 of a Pythagorean comma
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Meantone temperament was commonly used from early 16th century till early 18th century
- [6] [peer_reviewed] 31-TET closely approximates quarter-comma meantone temperament

- Topics: just intonation, microtonal scales, tonality diamond, harmonic limit theory, harry partch, consonance and dissonance, harmonic series, alternative tuning systems, rational intervals, equal temperament limitations, 43-tone

Summary:
Harry Partch developed a 43-tone just intonation scale based on an 11-limit tonality diamond, incorporating all rational intervals with odd factors up to 11. The scale includes 29 core ratios plus 14 additional 'multiple-number ratios' to fill gaps and provide complete harmonic structures. Partch chose the 11-limit because the 11th harmonic (551.3 cents) falls between standard 12-tone equal temperament pitches and is unfamiliar to Western ears, while lower harmonics are better approximated by existing tuning systems.

Claims:
- [1] [anecdotal] The 11th harmonic falls at 551.3 cents, right in the middle between two pitches of 12-tone equal temperament
- [2] [anecdotal] The 7th harmonic is poorly approximated by 12-tone equal temperament but appears in ancient Greek scales and barbershop quartet music
- [3] [anecdotal] Consonance of intervals decreases as the odd numbers of their ratios increase
- [4] [speculative] The 11th harmonic is the first that is utterly foreign to Western ears
- [5] [anecdotal] The added tones in the 43-tone scale form a constant structure of 41 tones with two variables, providing harmonic and melodic symmetry

Composition Parameters:
- tuningSystem: 43-tone just intonation scale
- frequency: 551.3 cents (11th harmonic)
- tuningSystem: 11-limit tonality diamond (29 ratios)
- note: Multiple specific ratios

Open Questions:
- How does the perceptual consonance/dissonance of intervals actually correlate with the complexity of their ratios?
- What is the empirical evidence for the 11th harmonic being 'utterly foreign' to Western ears?
- How do constant structures in microtonal scales affect melodic and harmonic perception?
- What are the practical performance challenges of implementing 43-tone scales on acoustic instruments?
- How do higher limit diamonds (13-limit, 17-limit) compare perceptually to the 11-limit system?

Summary:
Robert Edward Grant presents a geometric framework connecting 432 Hz Pythagorean tuning to circular geometry, claiming that musical notes map to specific angles on a circle that align with regular polygons and physical constants. He asserts that F# at 720 Hz corresponds to 186.32 degrees, which he connects to the speed of light (186.28 × 10³ miles/second). The work proposes geometric 'gap notes' between certain intervals and links musical relationships to fundamental forces. Grant also describes discovering that his meditation room's dimensions follow golden ratio proportions.

Claims:
- [1] [personal] 432 Hz Pythagorean tuning creates perfect geometric symmetry when mapped to a circle, with notes corresponding to specific degrees that form regular polygonal patterns
- [2] [speculative] F# at 720 Hz lands at 186.32 degrees on the circle, which correlates to the speed of light (186.28 × 10³ miles/second) with 0.0001 accuracy
- [3] [personal] B(5) note at 468 Hz (1.0833 × 432 Hz) creates an equilateral triangle when mapped to 300 degrees on the circle
- [4] [speculative] Musical 'gap notes' exist between B-C and before G#-A, appearing at right angles on the North-South and East-West axes, potentially relating to fundamental forces
- [5] [personal] All musical notes in this system have a digital root of 9, matching their geometric properties

Composition Parameters:
- rootNote: 432 Hz
- tuningSystem: Pythagorean
- frequency: 468 Hz
- frequency: 720 Hz

Open Questions:
- Can the claimed geometric relationships between 432 Hz tuning and circular degrees be experimentally validated?
- Is there any scientific basis for connecting F# at 720 Hz to the speed of light through angular measurements?
- How do the proposed 'gap notes' relate to actual acoustic or psychoacoustic phenomena?
- What measurable effects, if any, do these geometric tuning relationships have on listeners?
- Can the digital root patterns claimed for musical frequencies be mathematically verified across different tuning systems?

Summary:
Equal temperament is a tuning system that divides the octave into equal steps, with 12-tone equal temperament (12 TET) being the dominant Western system since the 18th century. The mathematical foundation involves dividing the octave by the 12th root of 2 (≈1.059463), creating semitones of 100 cents each. While 12 TET approximates just intervals reasonably well, it introduces small tuning errors, with thirds being the most affected intervals.

- [2] [peer_reviewed] In 12 TET, the frequency ratio between adjacent semitones is the 12th root of 2, approximately 1.059463
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Zhu Zaiyu (1584) and Simon Stevin (1585) are credited with the mathematical calculation of equal temperament
- [4] [peer_reviewed] 12 TET produces tuning errors compared to just intonation, with major thirds being 13.69 cents sharp and minor thirds being 15.64 cents flat
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Perfect fifths and fourths in 12 TET are very close to just intervals, with only 1.96 cents of error
- [6] [peer_reviewed] String instruments tuned in perfect fifths (violins, violas, cellos) use a semitone ratio of approximately 100.28 cents, slightly different from 12 TET
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Unfretted string ensembles and vocal groups sometimes use tuning closer to just intonation for acoustic reasons

Summary:
This is a comprehensive scientific examination of music theory, covering the physics of sound production in musical instruments, various tuning systems (just intonation, equal temperament, Pythagorean), and psychoacoustic principles of human sound perception. The work systematically explains how vibrating strings produce overtones, how different tuning systems create frequency ratios between musical notes, and how instruments generate sound through various physical mechanisms. It bridges the gap between the mathematical/physical foundations of music and the artistic experience.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] A vibrating string with fixed ends can only vibrate at certain frequencies determined by the wave equation, producing a fundamental frequency and overtones at integer multiples
- [2] [peer_reviewed] The speed of sound in air is approximately 340 meters per second under standard atmospheric conditions and is independent of frequency and intensity within a wide range
- [3] [peer_reviewed] High frequency components of sound decay faster with distance than low frequency components due to absorption coefficient being proportional to frequency squared
- [4] [peer_reviewed] The octave represents a 2:1 frequency ratio, discovered by Pythagoras around 500 BC
- [5] [peer_reviewed] In just intonation, the perfect fifth has a frequency ratio of 3:2, the perfect fourth 4:3, and the major third 5:4
- [6] [peer_reviewed] Equal temperament divides the octave into 12 equal semitones, each with a frequency ratio of 2^(1/12) ≈ 1.059463
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Human perception of musical note pitch is primarily determined by fundamental frequency, with lesser influence from intensity and harmonic content
- [8] [peer_reviewed] The phase of harmonic overtones does not affect human perception of sound quality, despite affecting the waveform
- [9] [anecdotal] Music appears to serve no obvious adaptive purpose, with Darwin noting it has no direct use in ordinary life habits

- frequency: 440 Hz
- tuningSystem: Just Intonation
- tuningSystem: Equal Temperament
- tuningSystem: Pythagorean Tuning
