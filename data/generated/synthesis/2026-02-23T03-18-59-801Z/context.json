      "extractionSummary": "Meantone temperaments are musical tuning systems that use slightly flattened fifths to produce purer major and minor thirds compared to Pythagorean tuning. Quarter-comma meantone was the dominant keyboard tuning from the early 16th to early 18th centuries, producing perfect 5:4 major thirds by tempering fifths by 1/4 of a syntonic comma. These systems create wolf intervals when confined to 12-note keyboards, but can be approximated by various equal temperament divisions like 31-TET for quarter-comma meantone.",

Notes are determined by the physical length of resonating portions, which can be tuned by repositioning or swapping different sized resonators. The 8-step sequencer supports complex polymeters through step skipping, and includes velocity control, envelope shaping, and modulation options.",
