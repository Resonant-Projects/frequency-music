    "hypothesis": "If we render one identical arrangement with tuning strategy (Golden ratio algebraic tuning (φ-octave, 8-note scale Sβ5) vs Golden ratio algebraic tuning (φ-octave, 10-note scale SN) vs 12-tone Equal Temperament (12TET) — reference system) while holding all other musical factors fixed, then listener ratings will show a consistent ordering in consonance and roughness between versions, because interval-ratio alignment and temperament error distribution change partial overlap and beating behavior.",
    "rationaleMd": "Selected sources converge on ratio-based and temperament-based explanations for consonance and roughness [S1, S2, S3].\n\nThe context includes explicit comma/temperament and interval evidence that supports a controlled comparison where only the tuning variable changes [S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6].\n\nFalsification criterion: if blinded ratings show no stable ordering across versions, or if roughness notes fail to cluster by version, the hypothesis is not supported.",
