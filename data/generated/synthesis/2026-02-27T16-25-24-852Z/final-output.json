    "question": "When one fixed arrangement is rendered in Golden ratio algebraic tuning (phi-octave Sbeta5), Golden ratio algebraic tuning (phi-octave SN), and 12-tone Equal Temperament (12TET), do consonance/roughness ratings diverge by tuning while continuity ratings remain tied to shared voice-leading path structure?",
    "hypothesis": "If only tuning is changed across otherwise identical renders, then consonance and roughness ratings will separate by tuning arm, with the strongest divergence in tritone-rich bars, while continuity ratings across sections with the same transformational path will remain comparatively stable. This is expected because interval-ratio and temperament error distribution alter beating and difference-tone behavior, whereas transformational/topological path identity constrains perceived harmonic continuity.",
    "rationaleMd": "The sources support a two-layer interpretation of harmony perception. Layer 1 is acoustic ratio behavior: consonance/roughness depends on ratio simplicity, periodicity, and temperament mismatch, and tritone treatment is a known fault line across systems [S1, S2, S6]. Layer 2 is structural continuity: harmonic motion can be represented as geometric/topological paths whose identity is partly independent of exact tuning values [S4, S8].\n\nA potential conflict exists between physically grounded claims (ratio/periodicity mechanisms) and cognitively grounded claims (historical pitch-space learning and line-of-fifths organization) [S2, S7]. This protocol resolves the conflict by measuring both: local roughness/consonance (acoustic layer) and section-level continuity (structural-cognitive layer).\n\nFalsification criteria: (1) no consistent arm-level separation in roughness/consonance; (2) no tritone-window amplification of differences; or (3) continuity ratings vary as strongly by tuning arm as roughness does, contradicting the proposed layer split.",

    "bodyMd": "## Goal\nTest whether tuning system changes mostly affect local sensory roughness/consonance while leaving structural continuity tied to shared path design [S1, S2, S4, S8].\n\n## Arrangement Design (single MIDI source)\nUse one 36-bar form at 82 BPM, 4/4, split into three analytical windows:\n- Bars 1-12: Diatonic corridor (fifths-range constrained vocabulary) to establish baseline stability [S7].\n- Bars 13-24: Tritone window with repeated pivot material (e.g., half-diminished to dominant region) to maximize sensitivity to tuning-dependent stress [S2, S6, S8].\n- Bars 25-36: Symmetry loop preserving transformational path class while re-voicing surface sonorities (L/P/R-like or equivalent contextual moves) [S4, S8].\n\nRender the exact same MIDI, instruments, automation, and mix in three tuning arms:\nA) Golden ratio algebraic tuning (phi-octave Sbeta5),\nB) Golden ratio algebraic tuning (phi-octave SN),\nC) 12TET reference [S1].\n\n## Evaluation Rubric\nFor each render, collect 1-7 ratings at section level for:\n- Consonance\n- Roughness/beating\n- Continuity of harmonic motion\n\nThen annotate bar-level peaks of roughness and classify them by window (baseline, tritone, symmetry). Evidence expectation: largest arm separation appears in tritone window; continuity rank should be more stable across arms than roughness rank if the two-layer model is correct [S2, S4, S8].",
