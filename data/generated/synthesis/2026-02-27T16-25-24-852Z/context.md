Summary:
This peer-reviewed paper proposes algebraic tuning systems where the conventional octave ratio of 2 is replaced by an algebraic unit τ, with the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618 as the primary example. Note frequencies are drawn from the ring Z[τ], enabling difference tones between notes to also fall within the tuning system. The authors construct two scales (8 and 10 notes per 'golden octave') based on β-expansions and norm bounds, analyze their additive (difference tone) and multiplicative (interval) properties, and connect the work to the Erdős–Szemerédi sum-product conjecture. A composition, Three Places, is provided as a demonstration of the tuning system in practice.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] In 12-tone equal temperament, consecutive pitches differ by a ratio of 2^(1/12), so that 12 semitones give a frequency ratio of 2 (the octave).
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Seven semitones in 12TET gives a frequency ratio of approximately 3/2 (the perfect fifth), but only approximately.
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Difference tones are perceived due to nonlinearities in the ear; their frequency equals the difference (or other simple linear combination) of the original frequencies.
- [4] [peer_reviewed] The Tsimané people of Bolivia do not appear to perceive octave equivalence at a frequency ratio of 2, suggesting octave equivalence is not a universal feature of human auditory perception.
- [5] [peer_reviewed] The ninth-century Musica enchiriadis treatises use a 'dasian' notation with equivalence at a perfect fifth (frequency ratio 3/2) and a 3-limit tuning system.
- [6] [peer_reviewed] The Bohlen-Pierce scale uses a ratio of 3 ('tritave') as its period and is well-suited for instruments with strong odd harmonics such as the clarinet; one motivation for it was difference tones.
- [7] [peer_reviewed] If the octave periodicity is an algebraic unit τ and frequencies are proportional to elements of the ring Z[τ], then difference tones between notes also lie in that ring.
- [8] [peer_reviewed] 36-TET contains an interval (25/3 semitones, approximately 833 cents) that is very close to the golden ratio φ.
- [9] [peer_reviewed] The golden ratio is maximally irrational in the sense that it is the most poorly approximated irrational by rationals, as formalized by Hurwitz's theorem.
- [10] [peer_reviewed] Three golden octaves span approximately 25 semitones (24.9957 semitones), making the golden ratio scale deployable via retuning a MIDI keyboard.
- [11] [peer_reviewed] A fundamental frequency of φ^(−12) Hz ≈ 55/φ Hz was chosen for the golden scale because it is close to a Fibonacci number; 55 Hz corresponds to A1 in standard 12TET (three octaves below concert pitch A4 = 440 Hz).
- [12] [peer_reviewed] It is possible, using a string with a single additional point mass, to produce a harmonic series beginning with frequency ratios 1, φ, φ², φ³.
- [13] [speculative] Irrational harmonics produce aperiodic waveforms, which may have fractal or non-differentiable properties for sufficiently large amplitudes.
- [14] [peer_reviewed] In the golden tuning, the 'golden third' interval (ratio φ^(1/2) or related) lies between the just minor third (6/5) and just major third (5/4), and is as irrational as possible.
- [15] [peer_reviewed] The golden scales have many difference tones (additive structure) but almost all intervals are distinct (multiplicative structure), consistent with the Erdős–Szemerédi sum-product phenomenon.
- [16] [peer_reviewed] 12TET contains a quadratic irrational ratio: six semitones (the tritone) gives a frequency ratio of √2.

Composition Parameters:
- tuningSystem: Golden ratio algebraic tuning (φ-octave, 8-note scale Sβ5)
- tuningSystem: Golden ratio algebraic tuning (φ-octave, 10-note scale SN)
- rootNote: α ≈ 55/φ Hz (≈ 33.99 Hz) — fundamental frequency of golden scale
- frequency: 55 Hz — Fibonacci frequency, A1 in standard 12TET
- tuningSystem: 12-tone Equal Temperament (12TET) — reference system
- tuningSystem: Bohlen-Pierce scale (tritave-periodic)
- tuningSystem: 36-TET (36 equal temperament) — contains ~833 cent golden ratio approximation
- tuningSystem: Dasian / 3-limit tuning (9th century)
- harmonicProfile: Modified string with single point mass producing φ-harmonic series
- note: Golden third interval (between minor and major third)
- note: Dissonant interval of ~1232 cents (just over one octave)

Open Questions:
- Given a fixed number of notes per golden octave, are the proposed scales optimal with respect to maximizing the number of arithmetic sequences (difference tones) in the scale?
- Can a growing sequence of algebraically-bounded note sets (e.g., elements of Z[φ] with bounded norm and β-expansion) serve as a concrete example to test or advance the Erdős–Szemerédi sum-product conjecture?
- How can a workable and precise nomenclature system be developed for pitches in golden ratio scales beyond the 5-digit β-expansion range?
- Can physical instruments (strings, pipes, percussion) be designed or modified to produce harmonic series at integer powers of φ, rather than integer multiples of a fundamental?
- What principles of melody, harmony, and voice-leading are most natural and effective within golden ratio tuning, distinct from 12TET conventions?
- How does listener perception adapt to φ-octave equivalence over extended exposure, given that octave equivalence itself is culturally variable?
- Can similar algebraic tuning systems be constructed for other Pisot units (e.g., silver ratio, plastic number, supergolden ratio) and what are their musical properties?
- Is the norm-bounded scale SN or the β-expansion-bounded scale Sβ5 more musically useful in practice, and by what criteria should 'usefulness' be judged?
- What are the perceptual consequences of the 'maximally irrational' golden third and golden fourth for consonance and dissonance judgments?
- How do fractal or non-differentiable waveform properties (from irrational harmonic ratios) affect timbre perception?

Summary:
This peer-reviewed study proposes a two-dimensional representation of musical chords using the simplicity of frequency ratios (S_F) and period ratios (S_P) as coordinate axes. The key finding is that major and minor triads are reflections of each other across the diagonal S_F = S_P, as are the half-diminished seventh and dominant seventh chords, a relationship rooted in musical inversion and harmonic dualism. The diagonal component (S_F + S_P) correlates with subjective consonance ordering (Major > Minor > Sus4 > Diminished > Augmented), while the perpendicular component (S_F - S_P) correlates with melancholy/sadness ratings from behavioral experiments. The authors speculate that chords in the harmonic region (S_F > S_P) are processed via frequency mechanisms and those in the subharmonic region (S_P > S_F) via periodicity mechanisms in the brain.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Simple frequency ratios are associated with consonance of musical intervals and chords, and consonance/dissonance perception is strongly related to the periodicity of chords.
- [2] [peer_reviewed] The probability distribution of amplitude-frequency combinations in human speech can predict consonance ordering, and intervals with simpler frequency ratios are more prevalent in speech.
- [3] [peer_reviewed] In awake primates' primary auditory cortex (A1), neurons with multipeaked tuning show peaks at harmonically related frequencies, and frequency relationships are more subharmonic than harmonic in nature.
- [4] [peer_reviewed] Major and minor triads are the only reflection pair among common triads in the S_F–S_P plane, and the half-diminished seventh (Ø7) and major-minor seventh (Mm7) are the only such reflection pair among seventh chords.
- [5] [peer_reviewed] The diagonal component (S_F + S_P) of the S_F–S_P representation predicts the subjective consonance ordering of triads: Major > Minor > Sus4 > Diminished > Augmented.
- [6] [peer_reviewed] The component perpendicular to the diagonal (S_F - S_P) correlates with melancholy/sadness ratings of chords from a 269-participant behavioral experiment.
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Musical inversion of a chord exchanges its frequency ratio and period ratio, which corresponds geometrically to reflection across the diagonal S_F = S_P in the proposed plane, and is the acoustic basis of harmonic dualism (Öttingen and Riemann).
- [8] [peer_reviewed] The major chord in just intonation has frequency ratio 4:5:6 and period ratio 15:12:10, and equal temperament approximates Maj-H (harmonic series) more closely than Maj-SH (subharmonic series).
- [9] [peer_reviewed] The major seventh chord (M7) is unique among triads and seventh chords in that its harmonic, subharmonic, and just intonation representations all share the same frequency ratio (8:10:12:15) and the same period ratio.
- [10] [peer_reviewed] M7 and m7 chords were rated highest in the liking dimension in behavioral studies, and their usage in popular music increased during the 1970s.
- [11] [peer_reviewed] Neural correlates of consonance/dissonance are found in the neural periodicities from autocorrelation functions of frequency-following response (FFR) signals, and dissonant intervals show intensified aperiodicity in subcortical responses.
- [12] [peer_reviewed] The Tristan chord is a half-diminished seventh chord (Ø7) voiced in open position, with its characteristic timbre enhanced by the lower two notes forming a tritone (A4) and the upper two notes a perfect fourth (P4).
- [13] [speculative] Chords in the harmonic region (S_F > S_P) are hypothesized to be perceived through frequency processing mechanisms, while chords in the subharmonic region (S_P > S_F) are hypothesized to be perceived through periodicity processing mechanisms.
- [14] [speculative] Harmony recognition with equal-tempered instruments is hypothesized to function via tuning bandwidths around characteristic frequencies of neurons responding to harmonic and subharmonic resonance.

- harmonicProfile: Just intonation interval frequency ratios
- harmonicProfile: Consonance ordering of triads: Maj > Min > Sus4 > Dim > Aug
- harmonicProfile: Tristan chord progression: Ø7 → Mm7 (dominant seventh), three times in first 11 measures

Open Questions:
- Does the S_F - S_P axis reliably predict melancholy/sadness ratings across cultures and musical training levels, or is this relationship culturally conditioned?
- Can the SF–SP plane framework be extended to larger chords (9th, 11th, 13th chords) or polychords, and do similar symmetry relationships hold?
- What are the neurophysiological mechanisms that implement distinct 'frequency processing' vs. 'periodicity processing' pathways for harmonic- vs. subharmonic-region chords?
- How does the tuning bandwidth of auditory neurons relate to the δ (deviation from equal temperament) threshold for chord acceptability, and can this be measured directly?
- Does the metaphorical association between subharmonic series (descending) and minor/melancholy character have a cross-cultural basis, or is it specific to Western tonal tradition?
- Why are diminished and augmented chords rated as neither particularly happy nor particularly melancholy, despite their extreme positions in the SF–SP plane?
- Can the SF–SP plane predict listeners' chord preferences or liking ratings more generally, beyond the consonance and melancholy dimensions?
- Is the increase in M7 and m7 chord usage in popular music during the 1970s related to their symmetric position on the SF=SP diagonal, and if so, what cognitive or cultural mechanism would explain this?
- How does the proposed chord recognition model (harmonic/subharmonic resonance within neural networks) account for the perception of chords in highly inharmonic timbres (e.g., bells, metallophones)?
- Could the SF–SP plane be used to systematically design novel chord progressions with specific emotional trajectories, and how would composers respond to such a tool?

Summary:
This peer-reviewed paper extends post-tonal music set theory in ℤn, generalizing interval-class vectors and trichord-type vectors to all cardinalities. It focuses on three musically significant cases: ℤ6 (hexachords), ℤ7 (heptatonic scales), and ℤ12 (chromatic scale in 12-TET). The paper provides type and class matrices, several theorems including a complete hexachord theorem, and MATLAB software for computing these structures in the general case. The work bridges abstract mathematics and practical composition tools, providing resources directly usable by researchers and composers working in atonal and post-tonal idioms.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Twelve-tone equal temperament (12-TET) divides the octave into 12 equal parts, and is the prevalent tuning system in contemporary music.
- [2] [peer_reviewed] In 12-TET, pitch classes are represented by integers 0–11, where 0 corresponds to C and 11 to B.
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Major and minor scales are heptatonic scales whose notes show great acoustical affinity among them.
- [4] [peer_reviewed] Heptatonic scales can be studied in a simplified and unified way in ℤ7 by considering divisions of the scale as unequally sized steps, though in this case a chord type usually represents pitch-class sets with different sonorities.
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Schoenberg's twelve-tone composition technique treats all 12 notes as equally relevant, and Hauer independently developed a 12-tone technique based on 'tropes' — pairs of complementary hexachords.
- [6] [peer_reviewed] The interval-class vector (ICV), also known as the 2-class vector (2CV), was first published by Forte as 'interval vectors' and characterizes set classes by their embedded dyads.
- [7] [peer_reviewed] The trichord-type vector (3TV), which lists the 3-note set types contained in each set type, was previously published and allows easy derivation of trichord-class vectors.
- [8] [peer_reviewed] Non-inversionally-symmetrical chord classes can only appear when the cardinality k satisfies 0 < k < n, and for composite n, there is always at least one such chord class for every valid k.
- [9] [peer_reviewed] The four basic triads in ℤ12 — diminished (3-10), minor (3-11a), major (3-11b), and augmented (3-12) — all map to a single chord class (3-4) when analyzed in ℤ7.
- [10] [peer_reviewed] A complementary reciprocity theorem holds for unweighted type contents: the number of times chord type X contains chord type Y (scaled by transpositional symmetry) equals the number of times the complement of Y contains the complement of X, scaled accordingly.

Composition Parameters:
- tuningSystem: 12-tone equal temperament (12-TET)
- note: C = pitch class 0, B = pitch class 11 in ℤ12
- harmonicProfile: G7 chord = [7, 11, 2, 5] in ℤ12, normal form [0, 3, 6, 8] (A♭7)
- harmonicProfile: Diminished triad (3-10) contains one tritone; weighted type content = 1
- tuningSystem: ℤ7 heptatonic abstract scale system
- tuningSystem: ℤ6 hexachordal system

Open Questions:
- How do type and class matrices in non-equal divisions of the octave (e.g., just intonation or microtonal systems) compare to those in 12-TET, and can the ℤn framework be meaningfully extended to continuous pitch spaces?
- Can the collapsing of the four basic triads (diminished, minor, major, augmented) into a single ℤ7 chord class be exploited compositionally to derive new voice-leading or harmonic relationships?
- What is the perceptual/psychoacoustic significance of inversional symmetry in chord classes — do listeners perceive inversionally symmetrical sets as more stable or neutral?
- The paper notes that 'acoustical affinity' characterizes heptatonic scale notes — what is the precise acoustic basis for this affinity, and how does it relate to harmonic series relationships or beating frequencies?
- How do the full type and class matrices for ℤ12 relate to known results in spectral music or acoustic composition, where harmonic spectra naturally suggest non-equal pitch-class weightings?
- Can Z-related chord classes (which share interval vectors but are not transpositionally or inversionally equivalent) be distinguished perceptually, and what are the implications for algorithmic composition?
- How might the MATLAB tools provided be extended to microtonal systems like ℤ19, ℤ24, or ℤ31, and what new musical structures would emerge?
- Is there a meaningful physical or acoustic interpretation of the complementary reciprocity theorem beyond its abstract mathematical form?

Summary:
This peer-reviewed paper generalizes Euler's Tonnetz — a geometric representation of pitch classes and harmonic relationships — to triangulated surfaces beyond the plane, using tools from Lie theory, crystallographic reflection groups, and Langlands duality. The authors construct edge-tonnetzes based on classical Lie algebra tilings (A2, B2/C2, G2) that encode major and minor triads, and show a striking correspondence between Langlands duality in mathematics and major/minor duality in music. A tonnetz on a sphere is constructed that encodes all 12 major ninth chords, while tonnetzes on tori encode subsets of major/minor triads with rich symmetry properties. The work frames the chromatic scale's structure as inherently geometric and proposes these new tonnetzes as potential compositional tools.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Euler's Tonnetz can be interpreted as a complete major/minor vertex-tonnetz on an A2-tiling of the plane, in which major and minor triads appear alternatingly as triples of vertices of triangles, with notes going up in fifths, down in minor thirds, and down in major thirds along the three directions.
- [2] [peer_reviewed] The mathematical Langlands duality — which swaps long and short sides of fundamental alcoves in Lie theory — corresponds directly to major/minor duality in music: applying Langlands duality to an all-major tonnetz produces an all-minor one, and vice versa.
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Angles between reflection hyperplanes in crystallographic tilings correspond to musical intervals: a 90° angle suggests a minor third (since four minor thirds stack to an octave), a 60° angle suggests a whole tone or major third, and a 30° angle suggests a minor second or perfect fifth.
- [4] [peer_reviewed] A tonnetz can be constructed on a sphere using 24 triangles paired into 12 quadrilaterals such that each quadrilateral encodes exactly one major ninth chord, yielding all 12 major ninth chords across the sphere.
- [5] [peer_reviewed] The G2-type major/minor edge-tonnetz is based on the circle of fifths and features six major and six minor triads in an alternating pattern; its Langlands dual contains the complementary set of six major and six minor triads, with qualities reversed.
- [6] [peer_reviewed] In the G2 torus tonnetz, rotational symmetries of the tonnetz correspond exactly to transpositions: 60° rotation about the central vertex equals transposition up by a whole tone; 120° rotation about hexagon corners equals transposition up by a major third; 180° rotation about 6-valent vertices equals transposition by a tritone.
- [7] [peer_reviewed] The B2/C2-type major edge-tonnetz on a torus contains exactly four distinct major triads (F, A, C♯/D♭, and D major), each appearing twice, while the four notes absent from these triads are the same four notes absent from the corresponding minor tonnetz — reflecting a shared key-signature structure.
- [8] [peer_reviewed] In equal temperament with 12 pitch classes, three transpositions of the B2 major edge-tonnetz cover all 12 major triads, and three transpositions of the C2 minor edge-tonnetz cover all 12 minor triads.
- [9] [peer_reviewed] In edge-tonnetzes, adjacent chords share at most a single note (the one labeling their common edge), unlike in Euler's vertex-tonnetz where adjacent triads share two notes — making edge-tonnetzes less suited to voice-leading analysis but still geometrically meaningful.
- [10] [peer_reviewed] The diminished seventh chord appears naturally at certain vertices of the B2 edge-tonnetz, arising from the prevalence of 90° angles in that tiling — since a 90° rotational symmetry of order 4 corresponds to transposition by a minor third, and four stacked minor thirds form a diminished seventh chord.

Composition Parameters:
- tuningSystem: 12-tone equal temperament
- chordProgression: F major, A major, C♯ major, D major (B2 edge-tonnetz on torus)
- chordProgression: F minor, A♭ minor, B minor, D minor (C2 edge-tonnetz on torus)
- chordProgression: 6 major + 6 minor triads alternating, circle-of-fifths based (G2 edge-tonnetz on torus)
- chordProgression: All 12 major ninth chords on sphere tonnetz
- harmonicProfile: Diminished seventh chord at 8-valent vertices of B2 tonnetz
- harmonicProfile: Augmented triads at hexagon-corner vertices of G2 torus tonnetz
- harmonicProfile: Whole tone scale major triads in G2-type tritone edge-tonnetz (Section 5)

Open Questions:
- Can the Langlands duality ↔ major/minor duality correspondence be given a deeper musical or acoustic explanation, beyond the geometric coincidence demonstrated here?
- Are there rank-3 or higher-rank generalizations of these tonnetzes that correspond to 3-dimensional or higher-dimensional musical structures (e.g., four-note chords in 3D space)?
- How do the exotic G2-type tritone edge-tonnetzes (Section 5) sound compositionally, and do their unusual symmetry groups produce perceptually interesting harmonic patterns?
- Can the sphere tonnetz encoding all 12 major ninth chords be used as a practical compositional constraint system, and what voice-leading properties does adjacency on the sphere imply?
- Is there a natural extension of this framework to microtonal or non-equal-tempered systems (e.g., just intonation), where the geometric angles might correspond to just-intoned interval ratios?
- What is the relationship between the Klein bottle tonnetz mentioned in passing and these surface tonnetzes — does Langlands duality extend meaningfully to non-orientable surfaces?
- Do the hyperbolic plane tonnetzes (based on pentagons, mentioned briefly) have analogues in these crystallographic Lie-theoretic constructions?
- Can the rotational symmetry ↔ transposition correspondence (e.g., 60° rotation = whole tone transposition in G2) be exploited to generate algorithmically coherent compositions by traversing the tonnetz geometrically?
- What perceptual or psychoacoustic significance, if any, do the diminished seventh chords at high-valence vertices of the B2 tonnetz have — are these natural 'pivot' chords in that harmonic space?
- How does restricting composition to a single edge-tonnetz (as suggested by the authors) affect perceived harmonic coherence compared to Euler's vertex-tonnetz?

Summary:
This peer-reviewed study quantifies fugue subjects from 238 organ works (Bach: 47, Reger: 45, Others: 146) using six integer-valued features: length, range, number of pitch classes, initial interval, number of unique intervals, and maximum interval between successive notes. Statistical analysis (PCA, Kruskal-Wallis, regression models) reveals that Bach's fugue subjects differ significantly from both Reger and other composers in range (compass), and all three composer categories differ significantly in the number of unique pitch classes employed. The study demonstrates that mathematical and statistical methods can meaningfully distinguish compositional styles across historical epochs. Key findings include that most fugue subjects across all categories employ 7–8 unique pitch classes, and that the initial interval between the first two notes does not significantly distinguish composer categories.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] A statistically significant difference exists between Bach's fugue subjects and those of later composers (Reger and others) with respect to the range (compass) of the subject, measured in semitones.
- [2] [peer_reviewed] A statistically significant difference in the number of unique pitch classes employed was found between all three composer categories (Bach, Reger, and other composers), with Reger's subjects tending toward higher values.
- [3] [peer_reviewed] The initial interval between the first two notes of a fugue subject does not significantly distinguish composer categories and is non-significant in regression models for subject range.
- [4] [peer_reviewed] Most fugue subjects in the dataset, regardless of composer category, employ typically 7 or 8 unique pitch classes, consistent with diatonic writing.
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Bach's D major fugue BWV 532 (Spielfuge type) is the longest subject in the Bach dataset at 64 notes, yet employs few unique pitch classes due to its sequential passage construction.
- [6] [peer_reviewed] Bach's fugue in E minor BWV 548 employs the maximum number of unique pitch classes (value of 11) among Bach's subjects, the highest observed in the Bach category.
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Among all fugue subjects studied, Bach has four works where the number of unique intervals equals a high value (BWV 543, 548, 564, 575), with only Schumann's second fugue on BACH op. 60:2 matching this among non-Bach composers.
- [8] [peer_reviewed] The compass of a fugue subject is typically centered around the octave (12 semitones), with distributions that are more symmetric than the right-skewed length distributions.
- [9] [peer_reviewed] The first principal component of the six fugue-subject features accounts for 51% of total variance, with the first three components together explaining 80%, indicating that a low-dimensional structure captures most of the variability in fugue subject characteristics.
- [10] [peer_reviewed] No significant differences between composer categories were found for the variables initial interval, number of unique intervals between notes, and maximum interval between successive notes, using Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric tests.

Composition Parameters:
- note: Semitone as unit of interval measurement
- harmonicProfile: Fugue subject range: mode ~12 semitones (octave), max observed >12
- harmonicProfile: Fugue subject length: mode varies, longest 64 notes (BWV 532)
- harmonicProfile: Fugue subject pitch class count: typical 7–8 out of 12
- instrument: Pipe organ
- harmonicProfile: Rheinberger Fuga cromatica: single interval type (semitone), minimum unique intervals
- harmonicProfile: Lemare fugue in D minor op. 98: maximum observed interval between successive notes
- harmonicProfile: Reger fugue subjects: no opening fifth interval observed
- harmonicProfile: Bach BWV 548 (E minor): 11 unique pitch classes in subject

Open Questions:
- Could these same quantitative features (length, range, pitch class count, intervals) be used to distinguish composer styles in non-organ fugues, such as keyboard or choral fugues, and would the same statistical differences between Bach and later composers hold?
- What acoustic or perceptual reasons underlie the tendency for fugue subjects to cluster around a range of one octave (12 semitones)? Is this a psychoacoustic optimum for melodic memorability or a practical constraint of counterpoint?
- Could machine learning models trained on these six features reliably attribute anonymous fugues to specific composers, and what additional features (e.g., rhythmic profile, harmonic rhythm, contour) would improve attribution accuracy?
- The study excludes 20th-century modern works (e.g., David's 12 Orgelfugen). How do dodecaphonic or post-tonal fugue subjects differ statistically from the tonal subjects studied here, particularly in pitch class count and interval distribution?
- Is the modal distribution of fugue subject length (right-skewed) consistent with Zipfian or other natural language/information-theoretic length distributions, suggesting common cognitive constraints on musical phrase construction?
- Reger's subjects show higher unique pitch class counts and no opening fifths — does this reflect a deliberate compositional choice to differentiate from Bach, or an organic consequence of his extended harmonic language?
- Could these quantitative features be used as generative constraints in algorithmic composition to produce stylistically authentic fugue subjects for a target composer category?
- The study notes that determining where a fugue subject ends is subjective. How much does inter-rater variability in subject boundary identification affect the statistical findings, and could automated score analysis reduce this ambiguity?
- Are there cross-cultural parallels to the fugue subject features identified here in non-Western contrapuntal or imitative forms (e.g., Indonesian kotekan, Indian raga development), and would similar statistical methods reveal analogous structural constraints?
- The compass of vocal fugues is noted to be constrained by human voice range — is there a quantifiable relationship between the tessitura/range of fugue subjects and the intended performance medium (voice type, instrument) that could inform orchestration decisions?

Summary:
This peer-reviewed paper proposes a new mathematical framework for tonality based on ratios of Gaussian integers (complex numbers), extending the traditional just intonation system which uses products of powers of primes 2, 3, and 5. The authors argue that the tritone—problematic in just intonation due to multiple unsatisfactory rational representations—can be elegantly represented as a single complex ratio (i). They construct complete major and minor scales using complex semitones derived from Gaussian primes, and prove the existence of exactly three distinct complex chromatic systems. The work bridges number theory, abstract algebra, and music theory, offering both a new compositional framework and a new analytical lens for Western music.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] No tuning system exists for keyboard instruments such that all harmonious intervals are perfectly tuned — this is described as a fundamental paradox at the heart of Western music.
- [2] [peer_reviewed] In just intonation, harmonious intervals are represented as products of powers of the prime numbers 2, 3, and 5: minor third = 6/5, major third = 5/4, fourth = 4/3, fifth = 3/2, minor sixth = 8/5, major sixth = 5/3, octave = 2.
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Ptolemy's intense diatonic scale, expressed with middle C = 1, takes the form C=1, D=9/8, E=5/4, F=4/3, G=3/2, A=5/3, B=15/8, C'=2.
- [4] [peer_reviewed] The syntonic comma (ratio 81/80) arises as a multiplicative discrepancy when the tonal centre is shifted in just intonation, causing instability in the system.
- [5] [peer_reviewed] The tritone (F#/Bb) in just intonation requires at least four distinct ratio representations, none fully satisfactory, motivating the search for an alternative framework.
- [6] [peer_reviewed] In equal temperament, the semitone is the irrational ratio 2^(1/12), meaning no interval except the octave is acoustically pure.
- [7] [peer_reviewed] The seven ecclesiastical (church) modes arise from permutations of the aggregation sequence of two whole-tone atoms (X=9/8, Y=10/9) and one semitone atom (Z=16/15) in just intonation.
- [8] [peer_reviewed] Exactly three distinct families of rational three-semitone chromatic systems exist that interleave Ptolemy's diatonic scale, each yielding 32 variant scales for a total of 96 scales.
- [9] [speculative] The tritone can be represented in the complex tone system as the ratio i (the imaginary unit), making it a single power of a single Gaussian prime — proposed as its most consonant representation.
- [10] [peer_reviewed] The set of complex 5-limit intervals modulo units and complex 5-limit phase factors forms a Generalized Interval System, generalizing existing real n-limit tone theory.
- [11] [anecdotal] Equal temperament's thirds are noticeably wide and acoustically impure, which critics argue gives triads an 'insecure and restless sound' and eliminates key differentiation.
- [12] [peer_reviewed] Middle C has a frequency of approximately 261.62 Hz.

Composition Parameters:
- tuningSystem: Just Intonation (5-limit, Ptolemaic)
- tuningSystem: Equal Temperament (12-TET)
- tuningSystem: Complex Tonality (Gaussian Integer basis)
- tuningSystem: Kepler's Monochord No. 2 (transposed down a fifth)
- frequency: 261.62 Hz (Middle C)
- harmonicProfile: Just intonation interval ratios
- harmonicProfile: Three-semitone Just Systems (Theorem 4.1)

Open Questions:
- Can complex tonality (Gaussian integer-based intervals) be realized acoustically, and what would compositions written in this system actually sound like?
- How would the three complex chromatic systems compare perceptually to equal temperament and just intonation in listener studies?
- Is there a physical or psychoacoustic justification for representing the tritone as the imaginary unit i, beyond mathematical elegance?
- Can the algebraic combinatorics of modal permutations (aggregation sequences) be fully formalized in the spirit of Dominguez, Clampitt, and Noll?
- What are the implications of 'shadow' real tuning systems derived from the magnitudes of complex intervals (Theorems 9.1 and 9.2) for practical instrument design?
- How does the complex 5-limit Generalized Interval System relate to existing neo-Riemannian and transformational music theory frameworks?
- Could higher Gaussian prime limits (analogous to 7-limit or 11-limit just intonation) yield additional musically meaningful complex tone systems?
- What would a keyboard or digital instrument interface look like that could navigate complex chromatic scales, given the non-real nature of some interval ratios?
- Is Newton's preference for the Dorian mode on account of its palindromic aggregation sequence musically or mathematically significant beyond symmetry?
- How does complex tonality handle the problem of enharmonic equivalence (e.g., C# vs Db) which equal temperament resolves by definition?

Summary:
This peer-reviewed study uses dimensionality reduction (PCA) on a large historical corpus of 2,012 Western musical pieces (ca. 1360–1940) to demonstrate that the line of fifths is the fundamental organizing principle of tonal pitch-class distributions. The authors show that the first two principal components of pitch-class distributions correspond to direction and distance along the line of fifths, accounting for 64% of total data variance. A key finding is a historically growing 'fifths range' — the span of pitch classes used in a piece along the line of fifths — reflecting the expansion from diatonic Renaissance music toward chromatic and enharmonic Romantic and modern compositions. The study also introduces 'pitch-class co-evolution' to track how pitch-class co-occurrence patterns changed over history. The authors argue these tonal relationships reflect cognitive models of composers and listeners rather than physical or logical necessities.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] The perfect fifth plays a fundamental role in the organization of tonal pitch space, and this can be empirically inferred directly from a large corpus of musical pieces using dimensionality reduction.
- [2] [peer_reviewed] The first principal component of tonal pitch-class distributions accounts for 41% of total data variance and corresponds to the direction (sharp vs. flat) along the line of fifths from D.
- [3] [peer_reviewed] The second principal component accounts for 23% of data variance and corresponds to distance from the center of the line of fifths, distinguishing natural from altered tonal pitch-classes.
- [4] [peer_reviewed] Together, the first two principal components of tonal pitch-class distributions account for 64% of total variance, compressing 35 dimensions into two interpretable axes of direction and distance on the line of fifths.
- [5] [peer_reviewed] D is the most frequent tonal pitch-class in the Western corpus studied, and serves as the center of the line of fifths around which pitch-class distributions are symmetrically arranged.
- [6] [peer_reviewed] The 'fifths range' of musical pieces has grown historically, reflecting an expansion from diatonic (range ≤ 6) Renaissance music to chromatic (range > 6) and enharmonic (range > 12) Romantic and modern compositions.
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Pentatonic scales occupy a span of 4 fifths (5 pitch classes), diatonic scales occupy a span of 6 fifths (7 pitch classes), and the two whole-tone scales correspond to alternating even and odd integers on the line of fifths.
- [8] [peer_reviewed] Tonal relationships in music reflect underlying cognitive models of composers, performers, and listeners rather than being physically or logically necessary properties of sound.
- [9] [peer_reviewed] The F major scale shares all but one pitch class with B♭ major (its neighbor on the line of fifths), but shares no pitch classes with F♯ major (seven fifths away).
- [10] [peer_reviewed] The fifths range measure is invariant under transposition, making it a useful tool for cross-historical comparison of harmonic content regardless of key.

Composition Parameters:
- harmonicProfile: Line of fifths segment F to B (35 tonal pitch classes)
- harmonicProfile: Diatonic scale = 7 consecutive pitch classes spanning 6 fifths
- harmonicProfile: Pentatonic scale = 5 consecutive pitch classes spanning 4 fifths
- harmonicProfile: Whole-tone scale = every other integer on the line of fifths (2 fifths per step)
- harmonicProfile: Chromatic threshold: fifths range > 6 indicates chromatic notes present
- note: D as tonal center (integer 0 on line of fifths)
- tuningSystem: Tonal pitch-class representation (non-enharmonic, potentially non-equal-temperament)

Open Questions:
- Would the same PCA results hold for non-Western musical traditions with different interval hierarchies — does the perfect fifth's centrality generalize, or is it culturally specific?
- How does the fifths range expansion correlate with specific compositional techniques (e.g., modal mixture, chromatic mediant relations) across historical periods?
- Could the line-of-fifths framework be productively applied to microtonality or extended just intonation systems where the line of fifths extends further than Western tonal practice?
- To what extent does the centrality of D as the most frequent tonal pitch class reflect notation conventions and instrument affordances (e.g., open strings, natural keys) rather than purely cognitive preferences?
- What is the relationship between a piece's fifths range and listener-perceived harmonic complexity or tension?
- Could pitch-class co-evolution patterns be used generatively — e.g., to constrain AI composition systems to historically informed pitch-class vocabularies?
- How do the PCA axes (direction and distance on the line of fifths) relate to psychoacoustic measures of tonal tension or key distance as measured in listener experiments?
- Does the fifths range measure correlate with other complexity metrics such as entropy of pitch-class distributions or harmonic rhythm density?
- How would the results change if pieces were analyzed in multiple local windows (phrase-level) rather than globally, given that pieces modulate through different regions of the line of fifths?
- Is there a maximum useful fifths range beyond which composers effectively abandon tonal organization, and does that threshold vary by era or style?

Summary:
This paper by Dmitri Tymoczko applies algebraic topology to music theory, specifically to model voice leading between chords using orbifold geometry and homotopy theory. The central argument is that chord spaces have non-trivial topological structure (annuli, simplices, cones over projective planes) and that voice leadings correspond to paths in these spaces whose homotopy classes encode musically meaningful transformations. The paper unifies neo-Riemannian theory, set-class theory, and voice-leading geometry by showing that the Tonnetz, interscalar matrices, and orbifold homotopy groups are deeply related. A formal 'voice-leading alphabet' of primitive transformations (transpositions-along-the-chord, voice exchanges, and contextual inversions) is introduced to classify all voice leadings between set classes.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Two-note chord space is ℝ²/(S₂ ⋉ ℤ²), with the two factors representing permutation (S₂) and octave equivalence (ℤ²), and transpositions along the chord do not appear among these global symmetries because their effect depends on the ordering of the dyad.
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Four-note transpositional set-class space is topologically a cone over the real projective plane with singular base and tip.
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Voice leadings correspond to paths in orbifold chord spaces, and two voice leadings are homotopic (belong to the same homotopy class) if one path can be smoothly deformed into the other — meaning the voice leading depends not on specific geometry but on topological features.
- [4] [peer_reviewed] Neo-Riemannian transformations L, P, and R can be understood as contextual inversions: for a triad in geometrical normal form 037, L is 𝔦₀ moving (0,3,7)→(0,3,8), R is 𝔦₁ moving (0,3,7)→(10,3,7), and P is 𝔦₂ moving (0,3,7)→(0,4,7).
- [5] [peer_reviewed] The fundamental group of transpositional set-class space is the semidirect product of the voice-exchange group with the cyclic group Cₙ, while for inversional set-class space it is the semidirect product with the dihedral group Dₙ; in chord space the transpositions along the chord are represented by ℤ.
- [6] [peer_reviewed] For an n-note chord in an o-note scale, transposition by n chordal steps is equivalent to transposition by o scale steps, and this equivalence is reflected by the topological equivalence of the associated paths in chord space.
- [7] [peer_reviewed] The Cohnian Tonnetz does not perspicuously reflect the underlying annular topology of the voice leadings it purports to model, even in its modified form that adds augmented triads.
- [8] [peer_reviewed] The interscalar interval matrices relating inversionally related chords depict the crossing-free subgroup of the homotopy group of trichordal set-class space, which in turn lifts to the Cohnian Tonnetz.
- [9] [peer_reviewed] A symmetrical chord is invariant under some word W — a combination of voice exchanges (cₓ), transpositions-along-the-chord (tᵧ), and contextual inversions (iᵤ) — and therefore chords near a symmetrical chord can be connected by efficient voice leading to their W-forms.
- [10] [peer_reviewed] The step-interval representation of a set class (e.g., 4, 3, 5 for the major triad) is related to the standard simplex, whose entries represent the set-class's step intervals expressed as fractions of an octave — a structure that appears throughout applied mathematics, including in representing the possible results of an n-candidate election.

Composition Parameters:
- chordProgression: Tristan chord (half-diminished seventh) → dominant seventh
- note: Major triad in geometrical normal form: pitch classes 0, 3, 7
- tuningSystem: 12-tone equal temperament (implicit); generalized to o-note chromatic scale with n-note chords
- harmonicProfile: Neo-Riemannian transformations L, P, R as contextual inversions on triads

Open Questions:
- How can nonbijective voice leadings (where doublings are flexible) be treated using the orbifold topological tools introduced here?
- What is the full classification of 'problematic paths' near singularities in set-class space, requiring a more sophisticated approach to orbifold singularities?
- How does the continuous multiplicative transform (moving linearly toward the perfectly even chord E, exchanging largest and smallest intervals) behave across a wider range of chord types?
- Can the voice-leading alphabet (cₓ, tᵧ, iᵤ) be extended to nonbijective voice leadings between chords of different sizes?
- What is the relationship between the generalized neo-Riemannian polygon models and higher-dimensional Tonnetze for chords with more than 3 notes?
- When is it musically appropriate to assert a genuinely dualistic neo-Riemannian transformation (L, P, R) versus merely an efficient voice leading between inversionally related chords?
- How do the orbifold homotopy groups change when the underlying scale is continuous and unquantized (the limiting case of pitch space)?
- Can the M-transform relationship between set classes (coordinate transformation near the perfectly even chord) be generalized to a broader theory of chord similarity?
