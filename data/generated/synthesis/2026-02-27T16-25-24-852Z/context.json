      "extractionSummary": "This peer-reviewed paper proposes algebraic tuning systems where the conventional octave ratio of 2 is replaced by an algebraic unit τ, with the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618 as the primary example. Note frequencies are drawn from the ring Z[τ], enabling difference tones between notes to also fall within the tuning system. The authors construct two scales (8 and 10 notes per 'golden octave') based on β-expansions and norm bounds, analyze their additive (difference tone) and multiplicative (interval) properties, and connect the work to the Erdős–Szemerédi sum-product conjecture. A composition, Three Places, is provided as a demonstration of the tuning system in practice.",

      "extractionSummary": "This peer-reviewed study proposes a two-dimensional representation of musical chords using the simplicity of frequency ratios (S_F) and period ratios (S_P) as coordinate axes. The key finding is that major and minor triads are reflections of each other across the diagonal S_F = S_P, as are the half-diminished seventh and dominant seventh chords, a relationship rooted in musical inversion and harmonic dualism. The diagonal component (S_F + S_P) correlates with subjective consonance ordering (Major > Minor > Sus4 > Diminished > Augmented), while the perpendicular component (S_F - S_P) correlates with melancholy/sadness ratings from behavioral experiments. The authors speculate that chords in the harmonic region (S_F > S_P) are processed via frequency mechanisms and those in the subharmonic region (S_P > S_F) via periodicity mechanisms in the brain.",

The paper provides type and class matrices, several theorems including a complete hexachord theorem, and MATLAB software for computing these structures in the general case. The work bridges abstract mathematics and practical composition tools, providing resources directly usable by researchers and composers working in atonal and post-tonal idioms.",

The authors construct edge-tonnetzes based on classical Lie algebra tilings (A2, B2/C2, G2) that encode major and minor triads, and show a striking correspondence between Langlands duality in mathematics and major/minor duality in music. A tonnetz on a sphere is constructed that encodes all 12 major ninth chords, while tonnetzes on tori encode subsets of major/minor triads with rich symmetry properties. The work frames the chromatic scale's structure as inherently geometric and proposes these new tonnetzes as potential compositional tools.",

Statistical analysis (PCA, Kruskal-Wallis, regression models) reveals that Bach's fugue subjects differ significantly from both Reger and other composers in range (compass), and all three composer categories differ significantly in the number of unique pitch classes employed. The study demonstrates that mathematical and statistical methods can meaningfully distinguish compositional styles across historical epochs. Key findings include that most fugue subjects across all categories employ 7–8 unique pitch classes, and that the initial interval between the first two notes does not significantly distinguish composer categories.",

        "Could these same quantitative features (length, range, pitch class count, intervals) be used to distinguish composer styles in non-organ fugues, such as keyboard or choral fugues, and would the same statistical differences between Bach and later composers hold?",
        "What acoustic or perceptual reasons underlie the tendency for fugue subjects to cluster around a range of one octave (12 semitones)? Is this a psychoacoustic optimum for melodic memorability or a practical constraint of counterpoint?",
        "Could machine learning models trained on these six features reliably attribute anonymous fugues to specific composers, and what additional features (e.g., rhythmic profile, harmonic rhythm, contour) would improve attribution accuracy?",
        "The study excludes 20th-century modern works (e.g., David's 12 Orgelfugen). How do dodecaphonic or post-tonal fugue subjects differ statistically from the tonal subjects studied here, particularly in pitch class count and interval distribution?",
        "Is the modal distribution of fugue subject length (right-skewed) consistent with Zipfian or other natural language/information-theoretic length distributions, suggesting common cognitive constraints on musical phrase construction?",
        "Reger's subjects show higher unique pitch class counts and no opening fifths — does this reflect a deliberate compositional choice to differentiate from Bach, or an organic consequence of his extended harmonic language?",
        "Could these quantitative features be used as generative constraints in algorithmic composition to produce stylistically authentic fugue subjects for a target composer category?",
        "The study notes that determining where a fugue subject ends is subjective. How much does inter-rater variability in subject boundary identification affect the statistical findings, and could automated score analysis reduce this ambiguity?",
        "Are there cross-cultural parallels to the fugue subject features identified here in non-Western contrapuntal or imitative forms (e.g., Indonesian kotekan, Indian raga development), and would similar statistical methods reveal analogous structural constraints?",
        "The compass of vocal fugues is noted to be constrained by human voice range — is there a quantifiable relationship between the tessitura/range of fugue subjects and the intended performance medium (voice type, instrument) that could inform orchestration decisions?"

      "extractionSummary": "This peer-reviewed paper proposes a new mathematical framework for tonality based on ratios of Gaussian integers (complex numbers), extending the traditional just intonation system which uses products of powers of primes 2, 3, and 5. The authors argue that the tritone—problematic in just intonation due to multiple unsatisfactory rational representations—can be elegantly represented as a single complex ratio (i). They construct complete major and minor scales using complex semitones derived from Gaussian primes, and prove the existence of exactly three distinct complex chromatic systems. The work bridges number theory, abstract algebra, and music theory, offering both a new compositional framework and a new analytical lens for Western music.",

      "extractionSummary": "This peer-reviewed study uses dimensionality reduction (PCA) on a large historical corpus of 2,012 Western musical pieces (ca. 1360–1940) to demonstrate that the line of fifths is the fundamental organizing principle of tonal pitch-class distributions. The authors show that the first two principal components of pitch-class distributions correspond to direction and distance along the line of fifths, accounting for 64% of total data variance. A key finding is a historically growing 'fifths range' — the span of pitch classes used in a piece along the line of fifths — reflecting the expansion from diatonic Renaissance music toward chromatic and enharmonic Romantic and modern compositions. The study also introduces 'pitch-class co-evolution' to track how pitch-class co-occurrence patterns changed over history. The authors argue these tonal relationships reflect cognitive models of composers and listeners rather than physical or logical necessities.",

      "extractionSummary": "This paper by Dmitri Tymoczko applies algebraic topology to music theory, specifically to model voice leading between chords using orbifold geometry and homotopy theory. The central argument is that chord spaces have non-trivial topological structure (annuli, simplices, cones over projective planes) and that voice leadings correspond to paths in these spaces whose homotopy classes encode musically meaningful transformations. The paper unifies neo-Riemannian theory, set-class theory, and voice-leading geometry by showing that the Tonnetz, interscalar matrices, and orbifold homotopy groups are deeply related. A formal 'voice-leading alphabet' of primitive transformations (transpositions-along-the-chord, voice exchanges, and contextual inversions) is introduced to classify all voice leadings between set classes.",
