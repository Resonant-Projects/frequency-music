Summary:
Meantone temperaments are musical tuning systems that use slightly flattened fifths to produce purer major and minor thirds compared to Pythagorean tuning. Quarter-comma meantone was the dominant keyboard tuning from the early 16th to early 18th centuries, producing perfect 5:4 major thirds by tempering fifths by 1/4 of a syntonic comma. These systems create wolf intervals when confined to 12-note keyboards, but can be approximated by various equal temperament divisions like 31-TET for quarter-comma meantone.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Perfect fifths in just intonation have a frequency ratio of 3:2
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Quarter-comma meantone produces just major thirds with a 5:4 ratio
- [3] [peer_reviewed] In quarter-comma meantone, the whole tone is the geometric mean of the major tone (9:8) and minor tone (10:9)
- [4] [peer_reviewed] 12-tone equal temperament narrows perfect fifths by about 2 cents or 1/12 of a Pythagorean comma
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Meantone temperament was commonly used from early 16th century till early 18th century
- [6] [peer_reviewed] 31-TET closely approximates quarter-comma meantone temperament
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Quarter-comma meantone creates a residual gap of 125/128 ratio or -41.06 cents between F# and Gb
- [8] [peer_reviewed] Third-comma meantone produces just minor thirds with a 6:5 ratio

- Topics: music therapy, pain management, hypoalgesia, neural oscillations, circadian rhythms, spontaneous production rate, tempo perception, personalized music, auto-ingested

Summary:
McGill researchers discovered that music provides optimal pain relief when its tempo matches an individual's spontaneous production rate - their characteristic rhythm tied to circadian rhythms. The study, published in Pain journal, suggests personalizing musical tempo could reduce patient pain levels by aligning with natural neural oscillations and pulling them away from pain-associated frequencies.

- [2] [peer_reviewed] Spontaneous production rate is tied to circadian rhythms
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Music played at an individual's spontaneous production rate provides the best pain relief compared to other tempos
- [4] [speculative] Neural oscillations responsible for preferred tempo can be pulled along more easily when musical tempo matches natural tempo, pulling them away from pain-associated neural frequencies

Composition Parameters:
- tempo: individualized to spontaneous production rate

Open Questions:
- What is the typical range of spontaneous production rates across individuals?
- How can spontaneous production rate be accurately measured for clinical applications?
- Do other musical parameters besides tempo affect pain relief when personalized?
- What are the specific neural frequencies associated with pain that music can influence?
- How long does the pain relief effect last with tempo-matched music?
- Can this approach be combined with other pain management techniques for enhanced effect?

Summary:
This paper proposes a method for predicting prime numbers using geometric distributions around polygons, specifically focusing on the 24-sided icositetragon. The authors claim to have discovered patterns in prime number distribution and developed a deterministic method for primality testing without trial division. While the mathematical claims about prime distributions are largely correct, the paper's connection to music/acoustics is limited to mentioning digital root patterns and the number 24's significance.

Summary:
Robert Edward Grant claims to have discovered a relationship between a 24-note quartertone musical scale and the geometric proportions of ancient pyramids at Giza. He proposes that musical intervals based on 432.081 Hz and 528.099 Hz 'Precise Temperament Tuning' correspond to pyramid slope angles and dimensional ratios. Specifically, he identifies the interval 11/9 (528/432 = 1.2222) as matching both the Giza Plateau perimeter ratio and Abu Rawash pyramid proportions. He suggests this 24-note system would better accommodate pentatonic and other indigenous musical scales compared to the standard 12-tone system.

Claims:
- [1] [speculative] A 24-note quartertone chromatic scale based on 432.081 Hz and 528.099 Hz corresponds to ancient pyramid proportions
- [2] [personal] The ratio 11/9 equals 528/432 = 1.2222 and matches pyramid geometric proportions
- [3] [speculative] A 24-note quartertone scale naturally allows for pentatonic and other indigenous scales while the 12-semitone scale does not
- [4] [speculative] Musical intervals can be mapped to ancient pyramid structures and their geometric relationships

Composition Parameters:
- frequency: 432.081 Hz
- frequency: 528.099 Hz
- tuningSystem: 24-note quartertone chromatic scale
- harmonicProfile: 11/9 interval (Divine Major 2.5th)
- tuningSystem: Precise Temperament Tuning

Open Questions:
- What is the mathematical basis for 'Precise Temperament Tuning' and how does it differ from established temperament systems?
- Are there peer-reviewed studies validating connections between musical intervals and pyramid geometry?
- How do quartertone systems compare acoustically and perceptually to 12-tone equal temperament?
- What evidence exists for intentional musical/acoustic design in ancient pyramid construction?

- Topics: geometric spirals, right triangle mathematics, natural pattern formation, hurricane categorization, galactic spiral arms, golden ratio alternatives, polygonal geometry, mathematical modeling of nature, fractal structures, harmonic ratios, spirals, fractals, right triangles, nature patterns

Summary:
This paper proposes a novel geometric model for natural spirals based on right triangle formations that create polygonal structures. The authors claim these triangular spirals match natural phenomena (hurricanes, galaxies, nautilus shells) better than traditional logarithmic spirals. They establish mathematical relationships where the 'mod' (number of triangles per rotation) correlates with physical properties like hurricane intensity. The work suggests fundamental geometric principles underlying natural spiral formation.

Claims:
- [1] [preprint] Triangular spirals based on right triangle formations match natural spirals better than hyperbolic logarithmic spirals (HLS) which use Euler's number e as expansion factor
- [2] [anecdotal] Hurricane intensity correlates directly with the 'mod' number of matching triangular spirals - stronger hurricanes have higher mod numbers
- [3] [anecdotal] Nautilus shells match mod(16) triangular spirals better than golden spirals, with 16 chambers per turn corresponding to triangle hypotenuses
- [4] [anecdotal] Galaxy spiral arm tightness correlates with mass concentration and corresponds to higher mod numbers in triangular spirals

Composition Parameters:
- harmonicProfile: Right triangle ratios [1:√3:2]
- harmonicProfile: Pentagon spiral ratios [1:1.37639:1.7013]
- frequency: Growth rate 1.1547 = 1/cos(30°)
- frequency: Growth rate 1.23606 = 1/cos(36°)

Open Questions:
- How do the harmonic ratios in these triangular spirals relate to musical intervals and acoustic phenomena?
- Could the mod numbers correspond to harmonic series or overtone structures in sound?
- Do the growth rates (like 1.1547, 1.23606) have acoustic significance or relate to frequency ratios?
- What is the relationship between these geometric ratios and musical tuning systems?
- Could natural spiral formations influence acoustic properties of environments (shells as resonators, etc.)?
- How might the mathematical relationships discovered here apply to sound wave propagation patterns?

- Topics: rhythm, tempo, biological rhythms, evolutionary musicology, communication, behavioral tempo, primate behavior, movement frequency, auto-ingested

Summary:
A peer-reviewed study analyzed sexual behavior in bonobos to understand rhythm and tempo in evolutionary communication. Researchers found that bonobo sexual movements averaged seven movements per second, and while mutual grinning didn't affect tempo, sexual movements significantly slowed after grinning stopped. This research aims to understand how rhythm, tempo, and vocalization evolved in humans and animals by studying our closest evolutionary relatives.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Bonobo sexual movements averaged seven movements per second during sexual interactions
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Mutual grinning (bared-teeth displays) had no correlation with the acceleration or deceleration of sexual tempo in bonobos
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Sexual movement tempo decreased sharply after mutual grinning stopped, potentially linked to physiological processes like orgasm

Composition Parameters:
- tempo: 7 movements per second

Open Questions:
- How do biological rhythms in sexual behavior relate to musical tempo preferences in humans?
- What is the evolutionary relationship between rhythmic movement in sexual contexts and musical rhythm?
- How might the 7 movements per second tempo in bonobo behavior relate to human rhythmic preferences?
- Could studying primate behavioral tempos inform our understanding of optimal musical tempos for human physiological response?
