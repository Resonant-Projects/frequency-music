      "extractionSummary": "Meantone temperaments are musical tuning systems that use slightly flattened fifths to produce purer major and minor thirds compared to Pythagorean tuning. Quarter-comma meantone was the dominant keyboard tuning from the early 16th to early 18th centuries, producing perfect 5:4 major thirds by tempering fifths by 1/4 of a syntonic comma. These systems create wolf intervals when confined to 12-note keyboards, but can be approximated by various equal temperament divisions like 31-TET for quarter-comma meantone.",

      "extractionSummary": "A peer-reviewed study analyzed sexual behavior in bonobos to understand rhythm and tempo in evolutionary communication. Researchers found that bonobo sexual movements averaged seven movements per second, and while mutual grinning didn't affect tempo, sexual movements significantly slowed after grinning stopped. This research aims to understand how rhythm, tempo, and vocalization evolved in humans and animals by studying our closest evolutionary relatives.",
