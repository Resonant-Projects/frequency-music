Summary:
Meantone temperaments are musical tuning systems that use slightly flattened fifths to produce purer major and minor thirds compared to Pythagorean tuning. Quarter-comma meantone was the dominant keyboard tuning from the early 16th to early 18th centuries, producing perfect 5:4 major thirds by tempering fifths by 1/4 of a syntonic comma. These systems create wolf intervals when confined to 12-note keyboards, but can be approximated by various equal temperament divisions like 31-TET for quarter-comma meantone.

Summary:
Equal temperament is a tuning system that divides the octave into equal steps, with 12-tone equal temperament (12 TET) being the dominant Western system since the 18th century. The mathematical foundation involves dividing the octave by the 12th root of 2 (≈1.059463), creating semitones of 100 cents each. While 12 TET approximates just intervals reasonably well, it introduces small tuning errors, with thirds being the most affected intervals.

- [2] [peer_reviewed] In 12 TET, the frequency ratio between adjacent semitones is the 12th root of 2, approximately 1.059463
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Zhu Zaiyu (1584) and Simon Stevin (1585) are credited with the mathematical calculation of equal temperament
- [4] [peer_reviewed] 12 TET produces tuning errors compared to just intonation, with major thirds being 13.69 cents sharp and minor thirds being 15.64 cents flat
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Perfect fifths and fourths in 12 TET are very close to just intervals, with only 1.96 cents of error
- [6] [peer_reviewed] String instruments tuned in perfect fifths (violins, violas, cellos) use a semitone ratio of approximately 100.28 cents, slightly different from 12 TET
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Unfretted string ensembles and vocal groups sometimes use tuning closer to just intonation for acoustic reasons

Summary:
This is a comprehensive scientific examination of music theory, covering the physics of sound production in musical instruments, various tuning systems (just intonation, equal temperament, Pythagorean), and psychoacoustic principles of human sound perception. The work systematically explains how vibrating strings produce overtones, how different tuning systems create frequency ratios between musical notes, and how instruments generate sound through various physical mechanisms. It bridges the gap between the mathematical/physical foundations of music and the artistic experience.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] A vibrating string with fixed ends can only vibrate at certain frequencies determined by the wave equation, producing a fundamental frequency and overtones at integer multiples
- [2] [peer_reviewed] The speed of sound in air is approximately 340 meters per second under standard atmospheric conditions and is independent of frequency and intensity within a wide range
- [3] [peer_reviewed] High frequency components of sound decay faster with distance than low frequency components due to absorption coefficient being proportional to frequency squared
- [4] [peer_reviewed] The octave represents a 2:1 frequency ratio, discovered by Pythagoras around 500 BC
- [5] [peer_reviewed] In just intonation, the perfect fifth has a frequency ratio of 3:2, the perfect fourth 4:3, and the major third 5:4
- [6] [peer_reviewed] Equal temperament divides the octave into 12 equal semitones, each with a frequency ratio of 2^(1/12) ≈ 1.059463
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Human perception of musical note pitch is primarily determined by fundamental frequency, with lesser influence from intensity and harmonic content
- [8] [peer_reviewed] The phase of harmonic overtones does not affect human perception of sound quality, despite affecting the waveform

Summary:
Robert Edward Grant presents a 'Unity Harmonica Geometric Theory' claiming that all uniform polyhedra can be generated from a single harmonic right triangle derived from their vertices and edges. The theory proposes that musical intervals emerge naturally from geometric ratios, with specific examples like the √2 tritone in tetrahedra and √3 cubic intervals in octahedra. Grant suggests this represents a unified theory connecting geometry, harmonic ratios, and musical structure through logarithmic spirals and classical mathematical means.

Claims:
- [1] [speculative] Musical intervals emerge naturally from geometric ratios in polyhedra, with √2 tritone in tetrahedra/cuboctahedra, √3 cubic intervals in octahedra/cubes, and golden ratios in icosahedra/dodecahedra
- [2] [speculative] Every uniform polyhedron can be completely generated by a single harmonic right triangle derived from its topological invariants (vertices V and edges E)
- [3] [speculative] Classical mathematical means (arithmetic, geometric, harmonic, quadratic) along with novel differential and logarithmic means can encode all polyhedral measurements through harmonic factors
- [4] [speculative] Geometry and music are fundamentally unified through harmonic ratios, as expressed in the statement 'The universe is harmonic geometry'

Summary:
Kyle Gann explains just intonation tuning, where pitches are defined as frequency ratios (like 3/2 for a perfect fifth) rather than equal temperament's 12 equal divisions. He argues that equal temperament, while allowing easy transposition, creates buzzy, less pure intervals compared to the mathematically simple ratios of just intonation. The article provides detailed examples of various tuning systems and claims that just intonation creates more meditative, introspective music while equal temperament promotes nervous energy and action.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] A 2-to-1 frequency ratio creates an octave interval
- [2] [peer_reviewed] A 3/2 frequency ratio produces a perfect fifth interval
- [3] [peer_reviewed] A 5/4 frequency ratio produces a major third interval

- [6] [anecdotal] Equal temperament creates audible beating between sustained pitches
- [7] [speculative] Equal temperament tuning is responsible for cultural psychology favoring progress and action over introspection

Summary:
Robert Edward Grant proposes the Resonance-Reversal Mass Inversion (RRMI) hypothesis, suggesting that mass emerges from standing wave resonance patterns rather than being an intrinsic property. The theory claims that destructive wave interference could create negative mass states, potentially enabling antigravity effects and superluminal travel. The paper links this to consciousness as a 'tuning agent' that affects material reality through resonance patterns.

Claims:
- [1] [speculative] Mass is a function of a body's standing wave resonance rather than an intrinsic scalar quantity
- [2] [speculative] Mass can be mathematically modeled as m ∝ 1/λ × A², where λ is effective wavelength and A is amplitude
- [3] [speculative] Destructive wave interference can create negative mass states through resonance nullification
- [4] [speculative] Mass inversion could enable antigravity, localized warp fields, and inertial dampening
- [5] [speculative] Consciousness acts as a tuning agent that affects material reality through resonance patterns
- [6] [speculative] Fundamental resonant frequency of a body can be expressed as ω = √(k/m)

Composition Parameters:
- frequency: fundamental resonant frequency ω

Open Questions:

Summary:
This academic paper explores the physics behind modern music, particularly focusing on how guitar amplifier distortion creates new musical notes not played by the musician. The authors examine the harmonic series, tuning systems, and why equal temperament tuning is mathematically imperfect but practically necessary. They demonstrate how nonlinear amplification generates additional frequencies through trigonometric principles and explain why some distorted chords create the perception of low notes that aren't actually present.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] When a musical note is played on an instrument, it vibrates not just at the fundamental frequency but also at integer multiples of that frequency (harmonics), producing overtones at 2x, 3x, 4x the fundamental frequency
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Consonant chords are composed of notes with the most overlap between their overtone series
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Equal temperament tuning is mathematically always out of tune because it uses irrational frequency ratios instead of the rational ratios found in natural harmonics
- [4] [peer_reviewed] Distorted guitar amplifiers create new musical notes that are not played by the musician through nonlinear amplification
- [5] [peer_reviewed] The 12-note Western musical scale is mathematically derived from the perfect fifth interval (3:2 frequency ratio) through Pythagorean tuning
- [6] [speculative] Standard guitar tuners using equal temperament are incompatible with good sounding music when amplifier distortion is involved
