Summary:
This paper presents a mathematical framework for embedding familiar pitch-class spaces (like 12-tone equal temperament) into larger microtonal systems while preserving their structural relationships. The approach uses group homomorphisms to systematically 'lift' smaller pitch spaces into ambient temperaments, allowing composers to explore microtonality without abandoning familiar harmonic intuitions. The framework introduces tuning spaces as collections of possible detunings and establishes categories with functors to study relationships between different tuning systems.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] 72-EDO provides excellent approximations of many just intervals and contains 12-EDO as a subset, making it ideal for composers exploring microtonality while maintaining connection to 12-tone music

- [3] [personal] Embedding pitch-class spaces into structured larger tuning systems provides systematic constraints that are more compositionally useful than arbitrary detunings
- [4] [personal] The challenge in microtonal composition is not expanding available materials but shaping and limiting them to support coherent musical form
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Higher pitch-class spaces contain unique intervals and harmonic possibilities unavailable in 12-tone equal temperament

Summary:
Meantone temperaments are musical tuning systems that use slightly flattened fifths to produce purer major and minor thirds compared to Pythagorean tuning. Quarter-comma meantone was the dominant keyboard tuning from the early 16th to early 18th centuries, producing perfect 5:4 major thirds by tempering fifths by 1/4 of a syntonic comma. These systems create wolf intervals when confined to 12-note keyboards, but can be approximated by various equal temperament divisions like 31-TET for quarter-comma meantone.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Perfect fifths in just intonation have a frequency ratio of 3:2
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Quarter-comma meantone produces just major thirds with a 5:4 ratio
- [3] [peer_reviewed] In quarter-comma meantone, the whole tone is the geometric mean of the major tone (9:8) and minor tone (10:9)
- [4] [peer_reviewed] 12-tone equal temperament narrows perfect fifths by about 2 cents or 1/12 of a Pythagorean comma
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Meantone temperament was commonly used from early 16th century till early 18th century
- [6] [peer_reviewed] 31-TET closely approximates quarter-comma meantone temperament
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Quarter-comma meantone creates a residual gap of 125/128 ratio or -41.06 cents between F# and Gb
- [8] [peer_reviewed] Third-comma meantone produces just minor thirds with a 6:5 ratio

Summary:
Research shows living human cells have natural mechanical resonance frequencies at 10-30 kHz and 150-180 kHz. Musical frequencies may interact with cellular vibrations and brain activity, triggering emotional responses through activation of reward circuits and dopamine release. Mathematical models can predict emotional responses to music with varying accuracy (13-82% variance explained). The connection between music, cellular resonance, and physiology suggests potential applications in targeted sound-based therapies.

Claims:

Summary:
This article explores tension and energy as fundamental musical concepts for electronic music producers. It categorizes tension into macro-tension (large-scale builds and transitions) and micro-tension (small details that maintain engagement). The author emphasizes these concepts are particularly crucial for dance music, where tension and energy directly impact whether listeners feel excited and want to dance.

Claims:
- [1] [personal] Tension and energy are among the two most fundamental musical concepts in music
- [2] [anecdotal] In a I-IV-V-I chord progression, the dominant chord (V) creates strong tension that demands resolution to the I chord
- [3] [personal] Dance music relies particularly heavily on tension and energy - lack of tension means listeners won't feel excited, lack of energy means they won't dance
- [4] [anecdotal] Musical tension is defined as the perceived need for relaxation or release created by a listener's expectations
- [5] [personal] Well-crafted tension keeps listeners engaged throughout a song because they want to hear resolution

Composition Parameters:
- chordProgression: I-IV-V-I progression

Open Questions:
- What are the measurable psychological and physiological effects of musical tension on listeners?
- Are there optimal ratios or patterns for tension/release cycles in different musical genres?
- How do cultural differences affect the perception of musical tension and energy?
- Can the layered approach to macro-tension be quantified or measured objectively?
- What role do frequency content and spectral characteristics play in creating tension?
- How does the relationship between tension and energy differ across various electronic music subgenres?

Summary:
This academic article examines composer Iannis Xenakis's use of Boolean algebra and mathematical set theory in his compositional process, particularly for the piece Herma (1959-1961). The research traces how Xenakis integrated algebraic concepts with musical time and perception theory, drawing from sources like George Boole's mathematical logic and Jean Piaget's developmental psychology. The analysis reveals how Xenakis attempted to formalize musical structures through Boolean operations, creating pitch reservoirs and sequential forms based on mathematical functions.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Xenakis defined 'temporal operators' in Boolean algebra for music: simultaneity as logical union and succession as logical intersection, where sound events are not simultaneous but without specified sequential order
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Musical time perception develops through three stages according to Piaget's theory: distinguishing events, recognizing temporal succession (non-commutativity), and metric time with commutative properties
- [3] [peer_reviewed] For the composition of Herma, Xenakis conceived three sets of pitches (A, B, and C) to build sequential form based on Boolean operations, with each section having a related pitch reservoir derived from these calculations
- [4] [peer_reviewed] A Boolean function with n variables can be written with a maximum of 2^(2^n) - 1 operations using union, intersection, and negation; for n=3 this equals 17 operations

Composition Parameters:
- chordProgression: Three pitch sets A, B, C with Boolean operations

Open Questions:
- How do Boolean algebraic structures actually correspond to perceptual experiences of musical time and simultaneity?
- What are the practical compositional advantages of using Boolean operations versus traditional harmonic progressions for organizing pitch materials?
- How do the mathematical constraints of Boolean algebra influence the aesthetic outcomes in pieces like Herma?
- Could modern computational tools expand on Xenakis's Boolean approach to create new compositional algorithms?
- What is the relationship between the visual representation of Boolean functions (Venn diagrams, logic circuits) and their musical realization?

Summary:
Equal temperament is a tuning system that divides the octave into equal steps, with 12-tone equal temperament (12 TET) being the dominant Western system since the 18th century. The mathematical foundation involves dividing the octave by the 12th root of 2 (≈1.059463), creating semitones of 100 cents each. While 12 TET approximates just intervals reasonably well, it introduces small tuning errors, with thirds being the most affected intervals.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] 12-tone equal temperament has been the most common tuning system in classical music and Western music since the 18th century
- [2] [peer_reviewed] In 12 TET, the frequency ratio between adjacent semitones is the 12th root of 2, approximately 1.059463
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Zhu Zaiyu (1584) and Simon Stevin (1585) are credited with the mathematical calculation of equal temperament
- [4] [peer_reviewed] 12 TET produces tuning errors compared to just intonation, with major thirds being 13.69 cents sharp and minor thirds being 15.64 cents flat
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Perfect fifths and fourths in 12 TET are very close to just intervals, with only 1.96 cents of error
- [6] [peer_reviewed] String instruments tuned in perfect fifths (violins, violas, cellos) use a semitone ratio of approximately 100.28 cents, slightly different from 12 TET
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Unfretted string ensembles and vocal groups sometimes use tuning closer to just intonation for acoustic reasons

- frequency: 261.626 Hz
- tuningSystem: 19 TET
