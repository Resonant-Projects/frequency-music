      "extractionSummary": "This paper presents a mathematical framework for embedding familiar pitch-class spaces (like 12-tone equal temperament) into larger microtonal systems while preserving their structural relationships. The approach uses group homomorphisms to systematically 'lift' smaller pitch spaces into ambient temperaments, allowing composers to explore microtonality without abandoning familiar harmonic intuitions. The framework introduces tuning spaces as collections of possible detunings and establishes categories with functors to study relationships between different tuning systems.",
