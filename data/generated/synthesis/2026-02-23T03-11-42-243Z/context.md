Summary:
Meantone temperaments are musical tuning systems that use slightly flattened fifths to produce purer major and minor thirds compared to Pythagorean tuning. Quarter-comma meantone was the dominant keyboard tuning from the early 16th to early 18th centuries, producing perfect 5:4 major thirds by tempering fifths by 1/4 of a syntonic comma. These systems create wolf intervals when confined to 12-note keyboards, but can be approximated by various equal temperament divisions like 31-TET for quarter-comma meantone.

- [2] [peer_reviewed] Quarter-comma meantone produces just major thirds with a 5:4 ratio
- [3] [peer_reviewed] In quarter-comma meantone, the whole tone is the geometric mean of the major tone (9:8) and minor tone (10:9)
- [4] [peer_reviewed] 12-tone equal temperament narrows perfect fifths by about 2 cents or 1/12 of a Pythagorean comma
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Meantone temperament was commonly used from early 16th century till early 18th century

- Reuse penalties: source=0.00, topic=0.00
- Topics: electron fluids, hydrodynamics, graphene, condensed matter physics, momentum conservation, shock waves, fluid dynamics, quantum materials, gurzhi effect

Summary:
Physicists have successfully made electrons flow like water in ultra-pure graphene, creating electron fluids that exhibit hydrodynamic behavior including shock waves when electrons exceed the 'speed of sound' for electron fluids (hundreds of km/s). This represents a fundamental departure from normal electron behavior in wires, where electrons scatter individually rather than moving collectively. The research could lead to new electronic devices and provides a new framework for understanding quantum materials through fluid dynamics.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Electrons in ultra-pure graphene can flow like water molecules, exhibiting collective fluid behavior rather than individual particle motion
- [2] [preprint] Electron fluids have a 'speed of sound' of a few hundred kilometers per second, and electrons can be accelerated past this threshold to create shock waves
- [3] [peer_reviewed] The Gurzhi effect predicts that in momentum-conserving electron systems, warming increases conductivity (opposite to normal wire behavior)

Composition Parameters:
- frequency: few hundred km/s

Open Questions:
- Could electron fluid dynamics be used to create new types of acoustic or vibrational devices?
- How might the frequency characteristics of electron fluids relate to audible sound or musical frequencies?
- Could the collective oscillations in electron fluids generate measurable electromagnetic frequencies in audio ranges?
- What are the resonant frequencies of electron fluid systems and how do they compare to acoustic resonances?

Summary:
This paper introduces a generative-first neural autoencoder architecture for audio that achieves significantly higher temporal compression (3360x downsampling) compared to existing reconstruction-first approaches (2048x). The new architecture provides 10x faster encoding and 1.6x lower latent rates while supporting both continuous and discrete representations in a single model. For practical applications, a 60-second mono audio signal can be compressed to just 788 tokens, making generative audio modeling more computationally tractable.

Summary:
John Stuart Reid presents a hypothesis that sound and frequency patterns may have played a fundamental organizing role in the emergence of life. He demonstrates how bubbles in water create Faraday wave patterns when subjected to specific frequencies, and argues these sonic scaffolding effects could organize prebiotic molecules brought to Earth by meteorites. Reid draws connections between cymatic patterns and biological structures like radiolaria and diatoms, suggesting that sound's ability to create order from chaos may be a key mechanism in abiogenesis that doesn't require intelligent design.

- [4] [speculative] Faraday wave patterns on bubble surfaces could provide organization mechanism for prebiotic molecules
- [5] [anecdotal] Sound compression creates observable changes in water's refractive index
- [6] [anecdotal] Cymatic patterns can reproduce structures found in biological organisms like radiolaria and diatoms

- frequency: 21 Hz
- frequency: 43.43 Hz

Open Questions:
- Can specific frequency combinations reliably organize prebiotic molecules into proto-cellular structures?
- What is the relationship between bubble resonance frequencies and the formation of biological patterns?

Summary:
This paper develops a unified mathematical framework for understanding music theory across different equal-temperament systems beyond the standard 12-tone system. Using abstract algebra and group theory, the authors propose axioms to determine keyboard configurations and key signatures for any n-equal temperament system. They redefine classical music theory concepts like the circle of fifths, dominant, and leading tone to work in general equal-temperament systems, showing how the arrangement of black and white keys follows mathematical principles.

Claims:
- [1] [preprint] The number of possible black/white key arrangements in an n-key octave follows a Fibonacci sequence
- [2] [preprint] The circle of fifths relationship stems from the mathematical property that n_w^(-1) ≡ 7 (mod 12) where n_w is the number of white keys
- [3] [preprint] Key signatures can be computed algebraically using modular arithmetic operations on scale sequences
- [4] [preprint] Enharmonic equivalence can be represented mathematically by allowing -1 and 12 as aliases of 11 and 0 respectively in Z₁₂
- [5] [preprint] The dominant can be generalized across equal-temperament systems as the note with number n_w^(-1) above the tonic

Composition Parameters:
- tuningSystem: 12-TET (12-tone equal temperament)
- tuningSystem: 19-TET
- tuningSystem: 31-TET
- note: Perfect fifth interval

Open Questions:
- How do these mathematical frameworks apply to microtonal composition in practice?
- What are the perceptual implications of keyboard layouts derived from different equal-temperament systems?
- Can these axioms be extended to non-equal temperament systems?
- How might electronic instruments implement these alternative keyboard configurations?
- What compositional possibilities emerge from systematically exploring non-12-TET systems?

Summary:
Equal temperament is a tuning system that divides the octave into equal steps, with 12-tone equal temperament (12 TET) being the dominant Western system since the 18th century. The mathematical foundation involves dividing the octave by the 12th root of 2 (≈1.059463), creating semitones of 100 cents each. While 12 TET approximates just intervals reasonably well, it introduces small tuning errors, with thirds being the most affected intervals.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] 12-tone equal temperament has been the most common tuning system in classical music and Western music since the 18th century
- [2] [peer_reviewed] In 12 TET, the frequency ratio between adjacent semitones is the 12th root of 2, approximately 1.059463
- [3] [peer_reviewed] Zhu Zaiyu (1584) and Simon Stevin (1585) are credited with the mathematical calculation of equal temperament
- [4] [peer_reviewed] 12 TET produces tuning errors compared to just intonation, with major thirds being 13.69 cents sharp and minor thirds being 15.64 cents flat
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Perfect fifths and fourths in 12 TET are very close to just intervals, with only 1.96 cents of error
- [6] [peer_reviewed] String instruments tuned in perfect fifths (violins, violas, cellos) use a semitone ratio of approximately 100.28 cents, slightly different from 12 TET
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Unfretted string ensembles and vocal groups sometimes use tuning closer to just intonation for acoustic reasons

Composition Parameters:
- frequency: 440 Hz
- tuningSystem: 12-tone equal temperament
- frequency: 261.626 Hz
- tuningSystem: 19 TET
- tuningSystem: 31 TET
- tuningSystem: 24 TET
- tuningSystem: 5 TET
- tuningSystem: 7 TET

Open Questions:

- What are the practical advantages and disadvantages of alternative equal temperaments like 19 TET or 31 TET?
- How do performers in practice deviate from theoretical equal temperament when playing?
- What role does cultural conditioning play in preference for 12 TET versus other tuning systems?
- How do the mathematical properties of different equal temperaments affect compositional possibilities?
