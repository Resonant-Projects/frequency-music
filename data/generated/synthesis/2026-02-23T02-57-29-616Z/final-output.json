    "title": "Adaptive JI Retuning Improves Stability During Rapid Modulation",
    "question": "When harmony modulates frequently, does dynamically adapting just intonation preserve perceived consonance better than static temperaments?",
    "hypothesis": "If a harmonically identical progression with frequent key center shifts is rendered using (A) dynamic adaptive just-intonation retuning, (B) static quarter-comma meantone, and (C) static 12-tone equal temperament, then listeners will report higher continuity and lower roughness in A than B/C, because adaptive tuning can minimize interval error per chord while respecting psychoacoustic short-term intonation memory over multi-second windows.",
    "rationaleMd": "The selected sources establish that consonance is linked to harmonic partial alignment and small integer relationships (S3, S4, S7). Static temperaments distribute unavoidable comma errors differently, creating fixed compromises across intervals (S1, S2, S6). The dynamic JI source explicitly models tuning as a global optimization problem and reports relevant psychoacoustic timing constraints, including an intonational short-term memory window around three seconds (S7). This supports a direct test where rapid modulation stresses static mappings, while adaptive retuning may preserve local consonance without changing composition content (S1, S7, S8).",

    "bodyMd": "## Goal\nTest whether dynamic retuning improves perceived harmonic continuity during frequent modulations.\n\n## Render Conditions\nProduce three renders from one shared MIDI arrangement:\n1. **A: Adaptive JI** (dynamic retuning per harmonic context; global compromise style) [S7]\n2. **B: Static quarter-comma meantone** [S1]\n3. **C: Static 12-TET** [S2]\n\n## Shared Musical Material\n- Length: 32 bars, 4/4, 84 BPM\n- Chord duration: 2 beats (new harmony every 1.43 sec at 84 BPM)\n- Modulation cycle every 8 bars (4 centers over 32 bars)\n- Voicing: 4-note pad + bass pedal motion\n- Identical MIDI, instruments, envelopes, dynamics, and mix levels across A/B/C\n\n## Tuning-Specific Setup\n- **A (Adaptive JI)**: Retune each harmony context to minimize cumulative interval error while preserving smooth transitions (no abrupt pitch jumps if smoothing is available) [S7].\n- **B (Meantone)**: Fixed quarter-comma meantone mapping throughout [S1].\n- **C (12-TET)**: Standard fixed semitone ratio tuning [S2].\n\n## Listening Tasks\nBlind-label exports as P/Q/R. Rate each (0-10):\n- harmonic continuity across chord changes\n- roughness/beating salience\n- overall musical coherence\n\nWrite short notes at bars where tension spikes.\n\n## Expected Pattern\nAdaptive JI should yield higher continuity and lower roughness during fast modulations than static mappings, with static quarter-comma typically between adaptive and 12-TET in this context [S1, S2, S7].",
