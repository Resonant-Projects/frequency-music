      "extractionSummary": "This academic paper develops mathematical functions to analyze harmony in Just Intonation, where frequencies are rational number ratios. The author introduces the 'Complexity' measure (ratio of LCM to GCD) and other invariant functions to quantify consonance, arguing that Just Intonation provides the fundamental basis for understanding harmony that 12-tone equal temperament only approximates. The paper presents tools for systematically exploring harmonies beyond traditional Western music.",

He advocates for Pythagorean tuning with A=432 Hz instead of the modern A=440 Hz standard, claiming this creates perfect geometric relationships where musical intervals correspond to specific polygon angles. The paper suggests these geometric-musical connections reveal fundamental relationships in nature, including a claimed connection between the F# frequency and the speed of light.",

Each tuning system created different sonic qualities for different keys, with meantone favoring sweet major thirds in certain keys while making others unusable, and well temperaments allowing all keys but with distinct character differences. The author argues that playing historical music in modern equal temperament obscures the original compositional intentions and tonal colors that composers relied upon.",

      "extractionSummary": "Meantone temperaments are musical tuning systems that use slightly flattened fifths to produce purer major and minor thirds compared to Pythagorean tuning. Quarter-comma meantone was the dominant keyboard tuning from the early 16th to early 18th centuries, producing perfect 5:4 major thirds by tempering fifths by 1/4 of a syntonic comma. These systems create wolf intervals when confined to 12-note keyboards, but can be approximated by various equal temperament divisions like 31-TET for quarter-comma meantone.",
