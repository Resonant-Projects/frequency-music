Summary:
This academic paper develops mathematical functions to analyze harmony in Just Intonation, where frequencies are rational number ratios. The author introduces the 'Complexity' measure (ratio of LCM to GCD) and other invariant functions to quantify consonance, arguing that Just Intonation provides the fundamental basis for understanding harmony that 12-tone equal temperament only approximates. The paper presents tools for systematically exploring harmonies beyond traditional Western music.

- [2] [speculative] 12-tone equal temperament has no explanatory power for harmony and only works because it approximates Just Intonation
- [3] [peer_reviewed] The Benedetti Height function (product of numerator and denominator in lowest terms) measures consonance complexity
- [4] [peer_reviewed] Ancient Greek consonant intervals were restricted to ratios between numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4
- [5] [peer_reviewed] By Mersenne's time, the musical numbers had expanded to include 5 and 6, enabling major and minor thirds
- [6] [anecdotal] Otonal and utonal versions of chords sound different despite being mathematically dual

Composition Parameters:

- frequency: 729:512 (diminished fifth)

Open Questions:
- How can mathematical complexity measures be validated against perceptual consonance studies?
- What are the optimal complexity thresholds for different musical contexts?
- How do higher prime limits (11, 13, etc.) affect harmonic perception in practice?
- Can the Complexity measure be extended to account for timbre and amplitude weighting?

Summary:
Just intonation is a tuning system where frequency intervals are whole number ratios, creating 'pure' intervals based on the harmonic series. Unlike equal temperament, these systems are categorized by 'limits' - the highest prime factor used in the ratios. The most common Western version is 5-limit tuning, exemplified by Ptolemy's intense diatonic scale, which creates perfect major and minor triads but introduces complications like wolf intervals.

Claims:
- [1] [peer_reviewed] Just intonation uses frequency intervals that are whole number ratios, making them 'pure' intervals from a single harmonic series
- [2] [peer_reviewed] In just intonation, if notes G3 and C4 are tuned as members of the harmonic series, their frequency ratio is 4:3
- [3] [anecdotal] Bowed string instruments are typically tuned using pure fifths or fourths, while keyboards use equal temperament
- [4] [peer_reviewed] The 5-limit just major third (5:4 ratio) deviates from 12-TET by −13.686 cents
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Ptolemy described a 5-limit diatonic scale called 'intense diatonic' in his 2nd century text Harmonics
- [6] [anecdotal] The Chinese guqin uses harmonic overtone positions marked by dots on its soundboard at specific fractional positions
- [7] [peer_reviewed] In Ptolemy's intense diatonic scale, the interval from D to A creates a wolf fifth with ratio 40/27 (about 680 cents)

Composition Parameters:
- tuningSystem: Ptolemy's intense diatonic (5-limit just intonation)
- tuningSystem: Pythagorean tuning (3-limit)
- frequency: 5:4 major third = 386.314 cents
- frequency: 3:2 perfect fifth = 702 cents
- frequency: 40:27 wolf fifth ≈ 680 cents

Open Questions:
- How do different just intonation systems affect emotional perception of music compared to equal temperament?
- What are the practical challenges of implementing just intonation in ensemble playing with mixed instruments?
- How do higher-limit just intonation systems (7-limit, 11-limit) sound in practice versus theoretical predictions?
- Can digital instruments effectively simulate the subtle beating and resonance effects of true just intonation?
- How did historical non-Western cultures develop their just intonation systems independently?

Summary:
Robert Grant proposes a unified mathematical model connecting geometry and music through regular polygons inscribed in a unit circle. He advocates for Pythagorean tuning with A=432 Hz instead of the modern A=440 Hz standard, claiming this creates perfect geometric relationships where musical intervals correspond to specific polygon angles. The paper suggests these geometric-musical connections reveal fundamental relationships in nature, including a claimed connection between the F# frequency and the speed of light.

Claims:
- [1] [speculative] Pythagorean tuning originally set the note A to 432 Hz, while modern tuning uses 440 Hz
- [2] [personal] Musical intervals can be mapped to regular polygons inscribed in a unit circle, with each note corresponding to specific angles
- [3] [speculative] The frequency of F# (720 Hz) corresponds to an angle that relates to the speed of light
- [4] [personal] Half steps in music correspond to 30° angles on the unit circle

Summary:
This historical overview demonstrates that equal temperament is a modern 20th-century phenomenon, while earlier European music (1500-1900) used various unequal temperaments like meantone and well temperament. Each tuning system created different sonic qualities for different keys, with meantone favoring sweet major thirds in certain keys while making others unusable, and well temperaments allowing all keys but with distinct character differences. The author argues that playing historical music in modern equal temperament obscures the original compositional intentions and tonal colors that composers relied upon.

Claims:
- [1] [anecdotal] Equal temperament was not widely used until the 20th century, with exact tuning methods only developed in 1917
- [2] [anecdotal] Meantone tuning was Europe's most successful tuning system, lasting approximately 400 years from late 15th to early 18th century
- [3] [anecdotal] Notes closer together in frequency create faster and more disturbing beats than notes farther apart when out of tune
- [4] [anecdotal] Bach did not use equal temperament for The Well-Tempered Clavier, but rather well temperament that allowed playing in all keys while maintaining key-specific character
- [5] [anecdotal] Students can distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate keys for Bach preludes when played in historical temperament
- [6] [speculative] Tuning has a pervasive influence on compositional tendencies and every piece of pitched music expresses a tuning system
- [7] [anecdotal] 1/4-comma meantone is closely approximated by 31 equal steps to the octave

Summary:
Meantone temperaments are musical tuning systems that use slightly flattened fifths to produce purer major and minor thirds compared to Pythagorean tuning. Quarter-comma meantone was the dominant keyboard tuning from the early 16th to early 18th centuries, producing perfect 5:4 major thirds by tempering fifths by 1/4 of a syntonic comma. These systems create wolf intervals when confined to 12-note keyboards, but can be approximated by various equal temperament divisions like 31-TET for quarter-comma meantone.

- [1] [peer_reviewed] Perfect fifths in just intonation have a frequency ratio of 3:2
- [2] [peer_reviewed] Quarter-comma meantone produces just major thirds with a 5:4 ratio
- [3] [peer_reviewed] In quarter-comma meantone, the whole tone is the geometric mean of the major tone (9:8) and minor tone (10:9)
- [4] [peer_reviewed] 12-tone equal temperament narrows perfect fifths by about 2 cents or 1/12 of a Pythagorean comma
- [5] [peer_reviewed] Meantone temperament was commonly used from early 16th century till early 18th century
- [6] [peer_reviewed] 31-TET closely approximates quarter-comma meantone temperament
- [7] [peer_reviewed] Quarter-comma meantone creates a residual gap of 125/128 ratio or -41.06 cents between F# and Gb
- [8] [peer_reviewed] Third-comma meantone produces just minor thirds with a 6:5 ratio

Summary:
This paper presents a computational methodology for analyzing microtonal intonation in oral music traditions, using pitch histograms, Dynamic Time Warping, and optimization techniques. The authors applied their approach to 145 pieces of Iranian Classical Vocal Music to extract tuning systems directly from vocal performances. The methodology reveals four distinct types of pitch histogram peaks and uses optimization to align intervals across multiple recordings, capturing both performance flexibility and underlying systematic tendencies.

- [3] [anecdotal] Koron is a microtonal modification in Iranian Classical Music that lowers pitch by approximately a quarter-tone, though exact tuning varies by performance context
- [4] [preprint] In Iranian classical music, intervals labeled as 'neutral second' can vary from approximately 120 to 180 cents depending on context and transcriber's framework
- [5] [preprint] Four distinct types of pitch histogram peaks can be identified in microtonal vocal music: well-defined Gaussian peaks, hidden secondary peaks, double-peaked mountains, and flattened/curved peaks

Composition Parameters:
- tuningSystem: Extended MIDI with microtonal resolution
- frequency: 44.1 kHz sampling rate
- note: Quarter-tone intervals (koron and sori)
