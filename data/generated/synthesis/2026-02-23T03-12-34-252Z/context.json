      "extractionSummary": "Meantone temperaments are musical tuning systems that use slightly flattened fifths to produce purer major and minor thirds compared to Pythagorean tuning. Quarter-comma meantone was the dominant keyboard tuning from the early 16th to early 18th centuries, producing perfect 5:4 major thirds by tempering fifths by 1/4 of a syntonic comma. These systems create wolf intervals when confined to 12-note keyboards, but can be approximated by various equal temperament divisions like 31-TET for quarter-comma meantone.",

      "extractionSummary": "Robert Edward Grant proposes 'Precise Temperament Tuning' as an alternative to equal temperament, using a base frequency of 432.081 Hz instead of 432 Hz. The system modifies the major third interval from 1.25 to 1.26 while keeping the perfect fifth at 1.5, claiming this creates a more 'geometrically perfect' tuning system. The approach reportedly connects musical intervals to geometric principles and has generated positive listener responses, though the evidence presented is primarily anecdotal.",
