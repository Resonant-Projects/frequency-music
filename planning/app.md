# App UX (SolidJS) — Screens for MVP

## Navigation
- Inbox
- Sources
- Hypotheses
- Recipes
- Compositions
- Weekly Briefs
- Admin (feeds, settings, roles)

## Inbox (most important screen)
- “New this week” items needing review
- For each source:
  - summary
  - extracted parameters preview
  - buttons: approve, edit extraction, promote visibility, generate hypothesis, generate recipe

## Sources
- filter by type (Notion/RSS/URL/YT/PDF), topic, tag
- view source + extraction + edit

## Hypotheses
- list + statuses
- create/edit with citations picker
- versioning UI (fork/iterate)

## Recipes
- list + link to hypothesis
- view in a “DAW-ready” format (copyable)
- export recipe as markdown

## Compositions
- create from recipe
- add progress notes + links
- attach listening sessions

## Listening sessions (embedded in composition view)
- quick form
- collaborator-friendly

## Weekly Briefs
