## Cadence Rules (to keep it productive)

### Mon–Thu: Collect + Distill
- goal: keep inbox near-zero “unextracted”
- limit: no more than 15 minutes/day of triage unless you choose otherwise

### Friday: Synthesize + Commit
- system generates candidate experiments
- you select **max 3**
- you commit to **1–2** for weekend execution (prevents over-scoping)

### Weekend: Compose + Evaluate
- default: micro-study first (16–32 bars)
- if a recipe is “obviously musical,” you may go straight to expanded/full

### Sunday Night: Update
- every executed artifact must end with:
  - observation + verdict
  - next action (expand/revise/retire/hold)

## Operating Constraints (quality + sanity)
1) **Single-variable revisions**: when revising, change one major variable at a time (tuning OR tempo OR timbre, etc.).
2) **Always store context**: headphones/monitors/time-of-day is not optional.
3) **Public publishing is editorial**: raw sources private by default; publish summaries + citations when clean.
4) **Body-first, but recorded**: subjective is valid—just make it comparable by using the same scales every time.
