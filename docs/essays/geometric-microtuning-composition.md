*Synthesizing Robert Edward Grant's geometric music theory with practical microtuning and compositional technique*

---

## Abstract

This essay bridges Robert Edward Grant's research on the geometric correspondence between musical intervals and polygonal shapes with practical microtuning systems and composition techniques. We derive a "Geometric Temperament" based on Grant's 432Hz findings, explore its mathematical foundations, and provide concrete guidance for composing with it.

## Part 1: Grant's Geometric Music Theory

### The Core Discovery

Grant's research reveals that when music is tuned to A=432Hz (rather than A=440Hz), the 12 chromatic notes correspond precisely to the internal angles of regular polygons. This isn't arbitrary numerology—it emerges from the mathematical relationship between the harmonic series and geometric symmetry.

**Key Relationships at 432Hz:**

| Note | Frequency (Hz) | Polygon Angle | Polygon |
|------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| C | 256 | 0° (360°) | Circle/Unity |
| C# | 272 | 30° | Dodecagon (12) |
| D | 288 | 60° | Hexagon (6) |
| D# | 304 | 90° | Square (4) |
| E | 324 | 120° | Triangle (3) |
| F | 341.3 | 150° | Dodecagon |
| F# | 362.4 | 180° | Line/Axis |
| G | 384 | 210° | - |
| G# | 406.4 | 240° | - |
| A | 432 | 270° | Square |
| A# | 456 | 300° | Hexagon |
| B | 483.3 | 330° | Dodecagon |

### The Perfect Fifth as Geometric Generator

Grant emphasizes that the **Perfect 5th (3:2 ratio)** is the geometric generator of musical structure. At 432Hz:
- The 5th spans 702 cents (vs. 700 in 12-EDO)
- This creates spiral geometry when stacked
- The Pythagorean comma (23.46 cents) represents the "gap" in the spiral

### Precise Temperament Tuning (PTT)

Grant proposes an alternative to equal temperament:
- **Major 3rd**: 1.26 ratio (vs. 1.25 in just intonation)
- **Minor 3rd**: 1.19 (falls from 1.2)
- **Perfect 5th**: 1.5 (pure 3:2)

This creates intervals that align with geometric proportions while maintaining practical playability.

## Part 2: Mathematical Framework

### Converting Geometry to Cents

To translate Grant's angles to a tuning system, we use the relationship:

```
cents = (angle / 360) × 1200
```

For a polygon with n sides, the internal angle is:
```
internal_angle = (n - 2) × 180 / n
```

### The Geometric Scale (derived from Grant)

Using polygon internal angles as scale degrees:

| Polygon | Sides | Internal Angle | Cents | Nearest 12-EDO |
|---------|-------|----------------|-------|----------------|
| Equilateral Triangle | 3 | 60° | 200 | D (whole tone) |
| Square | 4 | 90° | 300 | Eb (minor 3rd) |
| Pentagon | 5 | 108° | 360 | E-ish (between m3 & M3) |
| Hexagon | 6 | 120° | 400 | E (major 3rd) |
| Heptagon | 7 | 128.57° | 428.6 | E+ (wide major 3rd) |
| Octagon | 8 | 135° | 450 | F-ish (tritone region) |
| Nonagon | 9 | 140° | 466.7 | F- (narrow 4th) |
| Decagon | 10 | 144° | 480 | F (narrow 4th) |
| Hendecagon | 11 | 147.27° | 490.9 | F (4th) |
| Dodecagon | 12 | 150° | 500 | F (perfect 4th) |

### Deriving a 12-Note Geometric Scale

We can create a complete 12-note scale by:
1. Using polygon angles for primary intervals
2. Filling gaps with golden ratio (φ) divisions
3. Maintaining the pure 3:2 fifth

**Proposed Geometric 12-Note Scale (in cents from C):**

```
C:    0
C#:   100.89  (φ-derived)
D:    200     (triangle - 60°)
Eb:   300     (square - 90°)
E:    386.31  (pure 5:4 major 3rd)
F:    498     (pure 4:3 fourth)
F#:   600     (geometric center)
G:    702     (pure 3:2 fifth)
Ab:   800     (square complement)
A:    884.36  (pure 5:3 major 6th)
Bb:   1000    (decagon - 144°)
B:    1088.27 (pure 15:8 major 7th)
C':   1200
```

## Part 3: Compositional Application

### Chord Construction in Geometric Temperament

**Primary Triads** (using pure intervals):

| Chord | Notes | Intervals (cents) | Character |
|-------|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| C Major | C-E-G | 0-386-702 | Bright, stable |
| C minor | C-Eb-G | 0-300-702 | Square geometry |
| F Major | F-A-C | 498-884-1200 | Pure, warm |
| G Major | G-B-D | 702-1088-1402 | Brilliant |

**Extended Harmonies** (incorporating geometric intervals):

| Chord | Notes | Intervals | Geometric Source |
|-------|-------|-----------|------------------|
| Pentagon Chord | C-E-G-Bb | 0-386-702-1000 | Dom7 with decagon 7th |
| Square Stack | C-Eb-Ab | 0-300-800 | All square-derived |
| Hexagon Triad | C-E-G# | 0-400-800 | Augmented (hexagon) |

### Melodic Patterns

**Triangle Melody** (whole-tone based):
- Uses D (200¢) as primary interval
- Creates bright, ascending patterns
- Works well for uplifting themes

```
Pattern: C → D → E → F# → G#...
Cents:   0   200  400  600  800...
```

**Square Melody** (minor 3rd based):
- Uses Eb (300¢) intervals
- Creates diminished-feeling sequences
- Evokes mystery, tension

```
Pattern: C → Eb → Gb → A...
Cents:   0   300   600  900...
```

**Pentagon Melody** (golden ratio flavored):
- Alternates triangle and square intervals
- Creates organic, flowing lines

```
Pattern: C → D → Eb → F → G → Ab...
Cents:   0   200  300  500  700  800...
```

### Rhythmic Correspondences

Grant's work connects geometry to time. Apply polygon symmetries to rhythm:

| Polygon | Symmetry | Rhythmic Application |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| Triangle (3) | 3-fold | Triplets, 3/4 time, waltz |
| Square (4) | 4-fold | Standard 4/4, rock beat |
| Pentagon (5) | 5-fold | 5/4 time, 5-tuplets |
| Hexagon (6) | 6-fold | 6/8 compound, two-beat triplets |

**Example: Triangle-Square Polyrhythm**
- Melody in triplets (triangle geometry)
- Harmony changes on square beat grid
- Creates 3:4 polyrhythm with geometric meaning

### Tempo Relationships

If 432Hz = A, then octave-related tempos maintain resonance:

| BPM | Frequency (Hz) | Musical Relationship |
|-----|----------------|---------------------|
| 54 | - | A ÷ 8 (three octaves below) |
| 108 | - | A ÷ 4 (two octaves below) |
| 216 | - | A ÷ 2 (one octave below) |
| 432 | A4 | Reference pitch |

Using **108 BPM** or **72 BPM** (432 ÷ 6) maintains geometric coherence with the 432Hz tuning.

## Part 4: Practical Implementation

### Creating the Scale in Scala Format

```scala
! geometric-temperament.scl
!
Geometric Temperament based on Grant's polygon-angle theory
 12
!
 100.89
 200.00
 300.00
 386.31
 498.04
 600.00
 701.96
 800.00
 884.36
 1000.00
 1088.27
 2/1
```

### DAW Setup

1. **Tuning Reference**: Set master pitch to A=432Hz
2. **Load Scale**: Import .scl file into MTS-ESP or synth
3. **Tempo**: Use 108 BPM (or multiples/divisions)
4. **Time Signature**: Start with 4/4, experiment with 3/4 and 5/4

### Composition Workflow

1. **Foundation**: Build drone/bass on geometric root (C=256Hz)
2. **Harmonic Frame**: Use pure 5ths (702¢) for stability
3. **Color Intervals**: Add polygon-derived intervals for character
4. **Melodic Development**: Use triangle/square patterns
5. **Rhythmic Layer**: Match time signature to melodic geometry

## Part 5: Example Composition Sketch

**"Polygon Meditation"** - A Short Study

**Section A: Triangle Invocation** (measures 1-8)
- Time: 3/4 at 108 BPM
- Drone: C (256 Hz)
- Melody: C → D → E → D → C (triangle ascent/descent)
- Harmony: C major → G major (pure 5ths)

**Section B: Square Grounding** (measures 9-16)
- Time: 4/4 at 108 BPM
- Bass: C → Eb → Ab → G (square movement)
- Melody: Sustained E over changing bass
- Harmony: Cm → Ab → G → C

**Section C: Pentagon Flowering** (measures 17-24)
- Time: 5/4 at 108 BPM
- Arpeggios: C-E-G-Bb-D (pentagon extended chord)
- Melody: Incorporates golden-ratio intervals
- Builds to climax on pure C major

**Coda**: Return to drone, tempo halves to 54 BPM

## Conclusion

Robert Edward Grant's geometric music theory provides a framework for understanding tuning as spatial relationship. By translating polygon angles to cents and applying geometric principles to rhythm and tempo, we create a coherent system where pitch, time, and structure reflect the same underlying mathematics.

This isn't about mystical claims—it's about using geometric constraints as a compositional tool, the way a poet uses meter or a painter uses the golden ratio. The pure intervals create a different sonic character than equal temperament, and the geometric framework gives compositional decisions a structural logic.

**Next Steps for Exploration:**
- Extend to 24-note quartertone system (Grant's pyramid research)
- Map Unity Harmonica polyhedra to harmonic progressions
- Explore non-octave scales using Grant's spiral geometry
