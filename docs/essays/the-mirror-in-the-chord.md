# The Mirror in the Chord

*Frequency and period are reciprocals. Major and minor are reflections. These aren't metaphors — they're the same mathematical fact, viewed from two angles.*

## The Dual Nature of Sound

Every pitched sound has two equally fundamental descriptions: its frequency (how many cycles per second) and its period (how long each cycle takes). They're reciprocals: double the frequency, halve the period. This is trivially true and usually treated as a notational convenience — pick whichever is more useful for your calculation.

But a recent paper by Honingh and Murayama reveals that taking *both* descriptions seriously, simultaneously, unlocks a surprisingly rich geometry of chords. Their idea is simple: for any chord, compute the "simplicity" of its frequency ratios (s_f) and the "simplicity" of its period ratios (s_p), then plot the chord as a point in the s_f–s_p plane.

What emerges is a map where **the diagonal line s_f = s_p acts as a mirror**, and the reflection of any chord across this mirror corresponds to its musical *inversion* — the operation that swaps the ordering of intervals.

## Major and Minor: The Only Reflection Pair

Here's the striking result: among all common triads, **major and minor are the only pair that maps to each other under this reflection**. The major triad (4:5:6 in frequency ratios, 15:12:10 in period ratios) sits on one side of the diagonal; the minor triad (the subharmonic mirror, with those numbers swapped) sits on the other. They are reflections of each other in the most literal geometric sense.

The diminished chord? It reflects to another diminished chord. The augmented chord reflects to another augmented chord. The suspended fourth chord sits *on* the diagonal — it's its own reflection. Only major and minor are genuinely different chord types that mirror each other.

This is the same insight that Öttingen and Riemann formalized in the 19th century as "harmonic dualism" — the idea that minor isn't just major made sad, but major's structural dual, generated by *subharmonic* rather than harmonic relationships. The s_f–s_p plane gives this old idea a new, geometric home.

## The Same Duality, Everywhere

What's remarkable is how this frequency/period duality keeps surfacing across completely different mathematical frameworks:

**In the Tonnetz.** The generalized Tonnetz research (explored in a previous essay) showed that Langlands duality — one of the deepest structures in modern algebra — maps all-major tonnetzes to all-minor ones. Swapping long and short roots in a Lie algebra's root system is, musically, the major/minor swap.

**In the s_f–s_p plane.** Reflection across s_f = s_p is, algebraically, the operation of replacing every frequency ratio with its reciprocal — turning the harmonic series into the subharmonic series. This is exactly harmonic dualism.

**In pitch perception neuroscience.** The same paper cites evidence that the auditory cortex processes both harmonics and subharmonics. Neurons in primate A1 show response peaks at subharmonic frequency relationships (e.g., 1:2:3 in period ratios). The brain may literally have dual processing pathways corresponding to the two axes of the s_f–s_p plane.

Three completely independent lines of evidence — abstract algebra, acoustic geometry, and neurophysiology — all point to the same structure: **the major/minor duality isn't a cultural artifact or an accident of Western music theory. It's a consequence of the reciprocal relationship between frequency and period, which is itself a consequence of what waves are.**

## Beyond the Mirror: Consonance and Emotion

The s_f–s_p representation suggests two more speculative but tantalizing connections:

**The diagonal component predicts consonance.** If you project a chord's position onto the diagonal (s_f + s_p), you get a value that tracks well with subjective consonance ratings: major > minor > suspended > diminished > augmented. The further you are from the origin along the diagonal, the more "consonant" the chord sounds.

**The perpendicular component predicts emotional valence.** The component perpendicular to the diagonal (s_f - s_p) correlates with listeners' ratings of melancholy and sadness. Minor chords, which sit in the "subharmonic region" (s_p > s_f), score higher on melancholy. Major chords, in the "harmonic region," score lower.

If this holds up, it means the emotional character of a chord isn't arbitrary — it's geometrically encoded in the balance between its harmonic and subharmonic simplicity. Sadness lives on one side of the mirror; brightness on the other.

## The Seventh Chord Surprise

Among seventh chords, the only cross-category reflection pair is the dominant seventh (Mm7) and the half-diminished seventh (ø7). These are the chords that open Wagner's *Tristan und Isolde* — arguably the most harmonically revolutionary passage in Western music history. Wagner's instinct led him to the one pair of seventh chords that are true duals of each other.

The major seventh chord (M7) turns out to have identical frequency and period ratios across all three tone series (harmonic, subharmonic, just). It sits exactly on the diagonal — perfectly balanced between the harmonic and subharmonic worlds. And in behavioral studies, M7 and minor seventh are the most *liked* chords. The diagonal, it seems, is where preference lives.

## What This Means for Composition

The practical takeaway: **voice leading between dual chords should feel like crossing a mirror.** When you move from a major chord to its minor reflection (or from a dominant seventh to a half-diminished seventh), you're traversing the full width of the s_f–s_p plane while staying at roughly the same "consonance level" along the diagonal. This might explain why such progressions feel emotionally charged without feeling dissonant — you're changing the *character* of the sound without changing its *stability*.

For microtonalists and those working with just intonation, the s_f–s_p plane offers a way to visualize chord relationships that equal temperament obscures. In ET, every chord is an approximation of multiple just versions; the plane shows which version your tuning is actually closest to, and what its dual looks like.

## The Deeper Pattern

Every time we look at music through a new mathematical lens — group theory, topology, gauge theory, now this dual-simplicity geometry — the same structure keeps emerging: **music's deep organization comes from symmetry and its breaking.** The s_f = s_p diagonal is a symmetry axis. Major and minor break it in opposite directions. Consonance measures how close you are to the maximally symmetric point. Emotional valence measures *which direction* you broke the symmetry.

The reciprocal relationship between frequency and period is as basic as physics gets. That it generates the major/minor duality, predicts consonance, and correlates with emotional experience suggests that these aren't separate phenomena to be explained by separate theories. They're all reflections — in the most precise sense — of a single underlying fact about waves.
