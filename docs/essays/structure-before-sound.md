# Structure Before Sound: What Minimalist Hip Hop and Mathematical Music Have in Common

## Two Producers Walk Into a Lattice

In 1999, Timbaland released "Big Pimpin'" — a track built from what producer Snipe Young describes as "jagged, futuristic synths and off-the-grid syncopation." The arrangement was minimal. Two-piece chord progressions. Space where other producers would stack layers. The philosophy, as Young puts it: the *boom* comes from minimal arrangements, not quantity of sounds.

Around the same time, Tom Johnson — a minimalist composer living in Paris — was exploring a different kind of reduction. Johnson's pieces are built from mathematical structures: self-similar melodies, tiling patterns, block designs. His music isn't *about* math; it *is* math made audible. A melody derived from a Sierpinski triangle has a fractal self-similarity that you can hear before you can name it.

These two approaches seem worlds apart. But they share a deep structural insight: **the most powerful music often comes from letting a simple structural principle do the compositional work.**

## Structure-Aware Generation

A recent paper on automatic piano accompaniment generation makes this insight explicit. The researchers found that separating *high-level structural planning* from *note-level realization* produces dramatically better results than generating notes directly. Their system works in two stages:

1. **Plan the structure** — Determine harmonic rhythm, phrase boundaries, textural density, and voice-leading constraints
2. **Realize the notes** — Fill in specific pitches and rhythms within those structural containers

This mirrors what experienced composers and producers do intuitively. When Timbaland builds a beat, he's not thinking about individual notes first — he's thinking about *where the energy goes*. The syncopation pattern is the architecture; the specific sounds are furniture.

The paper formalizes this with "energy terms" for harmonic feasibility, structural-role compatibility, and voice-leading continuity. These are measurable properties of the *structure*, not the surface. The claim is strong: you can evaluate whether an accompaniment is well-formed by examining its structural properties alone, before hearing a single note.

## Self-Similarity as Structure

Tom Johnson's work takes this further. His self-similar melodies are generated by recursive processes — the same pattern appears at multiple time scales simultaneously. A four-note motif might define the shape of a four-bar phrase, which defines the shape of a sixteen-bar section, which defines the shape of the whole piece.

This isn't decoration. It's a structural principle that produces music with a particular quality of *inevitability* — the sense that each note belongs exactly where it is, because the structure demands it. Musicians and listeners feel this even when they can't articulate why.

The connection to Timbaland's minimalism is direct: both approaches derive maximum musical impact from structural clarity rather than surface complexity. A Neptunes beat has two or three elements, but their *relationship* — the syncopation pattern, the way the bass locks to the kick, the space between events — is architecturally precise.

## The Compression Thought Experiment

Here's where it gets really interesting. Recent neural audio compression research has achieved something remarkable: compressing 60 seconds of audio into just 788 tokens — a 3,360x temporal downsampling. At these extreme ratios, the compression algorithm must discard almost everything about the surface of the sound and retain only the *structure*.

The researchers found that diffusion models could reconstruct "convincing" audio from these ultra-compressed representations, but the reconstructions sacrifice "exact fidelity." In other words: the skeleton is preserved, but the skin is different.

This raises a profound compositional question: **what is the irreducible structural core of a piece of music?**

If you compress a Timbaland beat to 788 tokens, what survives? Presumably the syncopation pattern. The harmonic rhythm. The density envelope. The things that make it *that beat* rather than a different beat. The specific timbres, the micro-timing, the mix balance — those are the first things to go.

If you compress a Tom Johnson self-similar melody to 788 tokens, the recursive structure *is* the compressed representation. It might survive almost intact, because it was already minimal. The structure and the piece are nearly the same thing.

## Three Hypotheses

### 1. Structural Density as a Measurable Property

If structure-before-sound is a real compositional principle, we should be able to measure it. I'll call it **structural density**: the ratio of structural information to surface information in a piece of music.

A Neptunes beat has high structural density — almost every audible element is load-bearing, contributing to the rhythmic or harmonic architecture. A heavily orchestrated film score might have low structural density — many elements are decorative, adding color without changing the structural skeleton.

**Experiment:** Take three tracks with different apparent complexity levels. Compress each to extreme ratios (using a neural codec or even just a very low-bitrate MP3). Compare: which tracks retain their identity under compression? The hypothesis is that tracks with high structural density will be more recognizable after compression than tracks with low structural density — even if the low-density tracks sound "better" at full quality.

### 2. Self-Similarity as a Production Technique

Johnson's self-similar melodies use mathematical recursion. But self-similarity appears in production without formal math — when a hi-hat pattern echoes the kick pattern at double speed, or when a melody's contour mirrors the song's verse-chorus energy arc.

**Experiment:** Build a 32-bar piece where every element is explicitly self-similar across three time scales:
- **Micro** (1-2 beats): A rhythmic cell
- **Meso** (4-8 bars): The cell's pattern defines phrase shapes
- **Macro** (32 bars): The phrase shapes define the section arc

Use the same intervallic or rhythmic pattern at all three levels, but with different timbres and tempos. The prediction: listeners will report a sense of "rightness" or coherence even without being able to identify why. Compare against a version where the three levels use unrelated patterns.

### 3. Voice-Leading as the Bridge

The piano accompaniment paper's voice-leading energy term connects these ideas. Voice leading is fundamentally about *structural continuity* — how one chord connects to the next through minimal movement. It's a constraint on the structure, not the surface.

In the Virginia Beach aesthetic, the equivalent is how the bass locks to the kick drum pattern. The "boom" that Snipe Young describes isn't about the bass sound itself — it's about the *structural coupling* between bass and kick. They move as one thing.

**Experiment:** Take a simple progression (I-V-vi-IV). Create two versions:
- **Coupled:** Bass, kick, and harmonic rhythm all share the same structural pattern (same accents, same density changes)
- **Decoupled:** Same notes and rhythms, but bass follows one pattern, kick follows another, harmony follows a third

The prediction: the coupled version will feel more "minimal" and more impactful despite having literally the same content. The structure-level coherence creates the sensation of reduction even when the surface is equally complex.

## Why This Matters

Most music production advice focuses on the surface: which synth patch, which EQ curve, which reverb tail. But the research consistently points to structure as the deeper determinant of musical impact.

Tom Johnson proves you can build compelling music from nothing but a mathematical pattern. Timbaland proves you can build a hit from two chords and a syncopation grid. The piano accompaniment researchers prove you can generate better music by planning structure first. The compression researchers prove that structure is what survives when everything else is stripped away.

The implication for composition is clear: **start with the skeleton.**

Not "start with a cool sound" or "start with a melody." Start with the structural relationships: What's the rhythmic architecture? Where does energy accumulate and release? What patterns repeat at different scales? What elements are structurally coupled?

The sounds come last. They're the easiest part to change and the least important to get right early. Structure is the thing that makes music feel inevitable.
