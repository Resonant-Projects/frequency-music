# When Geometry Sings

*A basketball shoe and a horse larynx have more in common than you'd think. Both reveal the same principle: physical geometry doesn't just constrain sound — it creates pitch, timbre, and even multi-channel communication. For composers, this is both a physics lesson and an invitation.*

## The Squeaking Shoe Problem

A team at Harvard recently answered a question nobody thought was physics: why do basketball shoes squeak? Using cameras capturing up to a million frames per second, they discovered that sneaker tread intermittently slips and sticks to the court surface at *supersonic speeds*, producing sound waves. But the truly musical finding was about geometry.

Smooth rubber produces broadband noise — white noise, essentially. **Ridged rubber produces a clear tone.** The ridges on sneaker tread act as a waveguide, channeling the acoustic energy of friction into a coherent pitch. Moreover, the pitch is a function of rubber thickness: thinner blocks produce higher pitches, with a relationship so precise that the researchers manufactured custom blocks to play "The Imperial March" from *Star Wars*.

This is, in miniature, the physics of every wind instrument, every vibrating plate, every resonant cavity. Geometry transforms noise into tone.

## The Horse's Two Voices

A study in *Current Biology* reveals that horse whinnies contain two simultaneously produced sounds generated by entirely different mechanisms within a single larynx:

1. **Low-frequency vocal fold vibrations** (~200 Hz) — the same basic mechanism as human speech, where folded tissue vibrates as air passes through.
2. **High-frequency laryngeal whistles** (>1,000 Hz) — produced by turbulent airflow through the laryngeal geometry, more akin to birdsong than mammalian vocalization.

The researchers confirmed the dual mechanism with a beautifully simple experiment: they blew helium through excised horse larynxes. Helium raises the speed of sound, and since the whistle frequency depends on airstream speed while vocal fold frequency depends on tissue tension, only the whistle went up in pitch. The vocal fold component held steady.

Horses are the only known animal that produces both mechanisms simultaneously. The two channels convey different emotional information — the whinny evolved as a multi-channel communication signal, encoding distinct messages in parallel frequency bands.

## The Principle: Geometry as Sound's Source Code

Both cases illustrate a principle that runs deeper than either example:

**The geometry of a vibrating system determines not just the *quality* of sound but the *possibility* of pitch itself.**

In the basketball shoe, the transition from broadband noise to clear tone happens at a precise geometric boundary: the presence or absence of periodic ridges. The ridges create a waveguide — a structure that selects specific wavelengths from the chaos of friction, just as a flute's bore selects specific harmonics from the turbulence of blown air. No ridges, no pitch. Geometry is the precondition for musicality.

In the horse larynx, two different geometries — the elastic vocal folds and the rigid laryngeal passage — operate simultaneously on the same airstream to produce two independent frequency channels. The geometry doesn't just shape one sound; it creates a *polyphony* from a single breath.

## Connection to the Harmonic Series

This connects directly to the geometric framework we've been exploring in earlier essays. In "The Listener's Grid" (Essay 9), we saw how Goodman & Batten's pitch estimation framework projects the harmonic series onto a cylinder (ℤ₁₂ × ℤ), where fundamentals and their harmonics form compact geometric shapes (⊤ and Γ). The listener's brain solves a shape-decomposition problem to identify which tones are fundamentals and which are overtones.

The shoe and the horse add a physical layer beneath this. The reason the harmonic series exists in the first place is geometric: the boundary conditions of a vibrating string (fixed at both ends) or air column (open or closed at each end) select exactly those frequencies whose wavelengths fit the geometry. The standing wave equation is, at bottom, a geometric constraint.

So we get a three-level hierarchy:

1. **Physical geometry** (instrument shape, vocal tract, sneaker ridges) → determines which frequencies are produced
2. **Mathematical geometry** (the cylinder ℤ₁₂ × ℤ, the Tonnetz, OPTIC quotient spaces) → organizes those frequencies into navigable structures
3. **Perceptual geometry** (shape templates in the listener's grid) → decomposes the received signal back into sources

Geometry at every level. And the remarkable thing is that these aren't three separate geometries — they're facets of the same underlying structure. The physical boundary conditions of a vibrating string produce the harmonic series, which projects onto the cylinder as the ⊤/Γ shapes, which the auditory system has evolved to recognize. The math connects all three.

## The Waveguide as Compositional Metaphor

The basketball shoe finding suggests a compositional principle: **periodic geometric structure is what converts noise into pitch**. This is the waveguide principle, and it operates everywhere:

- A **flute** is a waveguide — a tube that selects harmonics from turbulent air.
- A **violin body** is a waveguide — a resonant chamber that amplifies and filters string vibrations.
- A **room** is a waveguide — its dimensions determine standing wave patterns (room modes) that color every sound produced within it.
- An **EQ filter** is a digital waveguide — a mathematical structure that selects frequencies from a signal.

The shoe experiment quantifies this: the relationship between ridge geometry and pitch is precise enough to *compose with*. That's the definition of a musical instrument.

For electroacoustic and spectral composers, this is an actionable insight. If you can control the geometry of a resonant system — physical or digital — you control the pitch content of its output. Granular synthesis, physical modeling, and waveguide synthesis all exploit this principle explicitly. But the shoe experiment demonstrates it at its most naked: friction + periodic ridges = melody.

## Multi-Channel Communication and Spectral Polyphony

The horse whinny finding points in a different compositional direction. The simultaneous production of two independent frequency channels from a single source is essentially **spectral polyphony** — multiple independent voices emerging from one instrument.

This has direct parallels in:

- **Overtone singing** (Tuvan throat singing), where a vocalist produces a drone fundamental and an independently controlled harmonic melody simultaneously.
- **Multiphonics** on wind instruments, where unusual fingerings or embouchure produce two or more simultaneous pitches from a single tube.
- **Spectral composition** (Grisey, Murail), which treats the harmonic series not as a fixed hierarchy but as a palette of independently manipulable partial frequencies.

The horse achieves this through geometric separation: two distinct physical mechanisms (elastic tissue vibration vs. turbulent airflow) operating on the same medium. This is exactly the principle behind the Tuvan singer's technique — the vocal folds produce the drone while the shape of the oral cavity (a resonant filter) selects and amplifies individual harmonics.

The emotional-channel hypothesis from the horse study adds another dimension: each frequency band carries *different information*. This resonates with psychoacoustic research on how we process music. Low frequencies tend to convey rhythm and harmonic foundation; high frequencies convey timbral detail and spatial cues. Composers have always intuitively exploited this — bass lines and melodic lines serve different structural roles not just by convention but because our auditory system processes them through partially independent channels.

## Toward a Unified View

Across these ten essays, a pattern has emerged: the mathematical structures that describe music (group theory, geometry, topology) aren't imposed on sound from above — they arise from the physics of sound production and perception. Geometry determines what vibrates, what frequencies emerge, how they organize, and how we hear them.

The sneaker ridge and the horse larynx are, in this light, two more data points in the same argument: physical geometry is the substrate of musical structure. When we write a tuning system, we're formalizing geometric constraints. When we design an instrument, we're building a waveguide. When we compose with spectral techniques, we're navigating a space whose geometry was determined by physics long before any human ear evolved to hear it.

The question this raises for future exploration: if physical geometry → harmonic series → mathematical music spaces, can we go backward? Can we start with a desired mathematical structure (say, a particular lattice or orbifold) and derive the physical geometry that would produce it? That would be, in some sense, the ultimate act of musically-informed instrument design: building the physics to match the math.
