# The Listener's Grid

*When you hear a chord, your auditory system solves a geometric puzzle. The mathematics of that puzzle turns out to be the same mathematics that composers use to navigate between chords — seen from the other side of the mirror.*

## The Problem of Hearing

Here's something we take for granted: when a cello plays a C, your ear receives not just C but also C an octave up, G above that, C two octaves up, E, G, and so on — the harmonic series. When a flute simultaneously plays a G, its own harmonic series overlaps with the cello's. Some of the frequencies arriving at your ear are fundamentals (notes actually being played) and some are harmonics (overtones generated by those fundamentals). Your brain disambiguates this mess effortlessly. Computers find it remarkably hard.

A recent paper by Goodman and Batten proposes a geometric framework for this problem that, in its elegance, reveals something deeper about the relationship between hearing music and writing it.

## A Cylinder of Tones

The key move is the choice of coordinate system. Instead of arranging pitches chromatically (C, C♯, D, D♯, ...), Goodman arranges them by fifths: C, G, D, A, E, B, F♯, C♯, G♯, D♯, A♯, F. The horizontal axis is this circle of fifths; the vertical axis is octave number. Since the circle of fifths wraps around after 12 steps, the left and right edges of the grid identify — the space is a **discrete cylinder**, formally ℤ₁₂ × ℤ.

Why fifths? Because in this coordinate system, a fundamental and its first three harmonics (octave, fifth, second octave) land in a *spatially compact* pattern. If you'd used chromatic ordering, the harmonics would scatter across the grid. In fifth-ordering, they cluster into one of exactly two shapes depending on position: a **turnstile** (⊤) or a **gamma** (Γ).

This is already beautiful: the physics of the harmonic series, projected onto the geometry of the circle of fifths, produces just two templates. All of pitch estimation reduces to: *given a pattern of activated cells on the cylinder, decompose it into overlapping ⊤ and Γ shapes.*

## Group Actions and Shape Duality

The geometry isn't ad hoc — it has precise algebraic structure. Define two generators: δ (rotate the cylinder by one fifth) and ω (shift up one octave). These generate a group action of ℤ₁₂ × ℤ on the grid. The ⊤ and Γ shapes can be written as orbits under specific combinations of δ and ω applied to a fundamental tone.

For the turnstile shape: starting from a fundamental at position (p, j), its harmonics sit at (p, j+1), (p+1, j), and (p, j+2) — one step right on the circle of fifths and vertical shifts. For gamma: the same, but with the second harmonic crossing the octave boundary differently, shifting the shape.

The crucial point: **⊤ and Γ are related by a group-theoretic inversion**. Each shape has an inverse — ⊤⁻¹ and L (the reflected gamma) — and finding a tone's generator means searching these inverse shapes. The duality between a shape and its inverse is the duality between "this tone is a fundamental" and "this tone is a harmonic of something else."

This is not the major/minor duality of harmonic dualism, nor the long-root/short-root duality of Langlands theory. It's a **source/echo duality** — the ambiguity between a sound and its reflection. Yet it lives in the same algebraic habitat (group actions on ℤ₁₂) and has the same formal structure (pairs related by inversion).

## False Fundamentals: Where Geometry Gets Interesting

The paper's deepest contribution is the theory of **false fundamentals** — tones that *look* like fundamentals (they sit at the apex of a ⊤ or Γ shape) but are actually harmonics of something else. The overlapping of harmonic series from multiple simultaneous notes creates patterns where harmonics accidentally form the shape of a fundamental they aren't.

Goodman proves a remarkable boundedness result: to check whether any tone is a false fundamental, you only need to search a 4 × 4 region of the grid centered on it. No matter how complex the polyphony, the geometry constrains the search space. This is a direct consequence of the compactness of the ⊤ and Γ shapes — because harmonics don't scatter far in the fifth-ordered grid, neither can the sources of false fundamentals.

The paper then classifies **basic edge cases** — configurations where exactly one false fundamental appears. These fall into discrete types, categorized by which of the three possible two-column configurations (⊤⊤, ⊤Γ, ΓΓ) they inhabit. The classification has an unexpected combinatorial crispness: there are exactly 27 basic edge cases per configuration, organized into types that are invariant across configurations.

## Two Sides of the Same Cylinder

Here's what strikes me most: Goodman's cylinder is essentially a discrete version of Euler's Tonnetz, rotated. The Tonnetz arranges notes so that horizontal motion is by fifths and diagonal motion is by thirds. Goodman's grid uses fifths horizontally and octaves vertically. Both are projections of the same underlying lattice of pitch relationships onto a cylinder (or torus, in the Tonnetz case — which adds the identification of octaves that Goodman leaves open).

But they serve opposite purposes:

- **The Tonnetz** is a composer's map. It shows how chords relate to each other. Moving on the Tonnetz is moving through harmonic space — from C major to A minor, from functional harmony to neo-Riemannian voice leading.

- **Goodman's grid** is a listener's map. It shows how a sound field decomposes into sources. Moving on the grid is disambiguating fundamentals from harmonics — the perceptual inverse of the compositional problem.

Tymoczko's OPTIC framework deepens this connection. His five operations — Octave shift, Permutation, Transposition, Inversion, and Cardinality change — define equivalence classes on collections of notes. The quotient spaces formed by these equivalences have remarkable topology: two-note chord space is a Möbius strip, three-note chord space is a twisted triangular prism. Goodman's cylinder is the space *before* these quotients are taken — the raw pitch space on which Tymoczko's operations act.

In other words: **Goodman's grid is the universal cover of Tymoczko's chord spaces**, or close to it. The composer navigates the quotient (where inversions and transpositions are identified); the listener works in the cover (where every tone has a specific pitch height and chroma, and the job is to trace each one back to its source).

## The Duality Deepens

This connects to the duality theme that has run through these essays. In Essay 8 ("Duality All the Way Down"), I catalogued four distinct dualities — frequency/period, Langlands, constraint, and grid shape — and asked whether they might all be projections of a single underlying structure.

The Goodman paper adds a crucial piece to this puzzle. The source/echo duality (fundamental vs. harmonic) is arguably the most *physical* of all the dualities we've encountered. It's not an abstract mathematical symmetry — it's what your cochlea deals with every time you hear polyphonic sound. And yet it manifests as a group-theoretic inversion on the same ℤ₁₂ that hosts all the other dualities.

Consider the chain:
1. **Physics** gives us the harmonic series (multiplicative structure of integer frequency ratios)
2. **Perception** maps this through a logarithm into additive pitch space
3. **Geometry** organizes this additive space into a cylinder (ℤ₁₂ × ℤ)
4. **Group theory** on this cylinder produces shape pairs (⊤/Γ and their inverses)
5. **The listener's task** is to decompose observed patterns into these shapes
6. **The composer's task** is to navigate the quotient spaces built from the same cylinder

Steps 1–4 are determined by physics and mathematics. Steps 5 and 6 are the two faces of musical cognition — perception and creation — and they operate on the same geometric object, viewed from opposite sides. The listener decomposes; the composer composes. The shapes are the same; the direction is reversed.

## Compositional Implications

**Exploit the false fundamental ambiguity.** When a set of notes creates a false fundamental — a phantom tone that the ear briefly interprets as real — you've created a moment of perceptual ambiguity. This is the geometric equivalent of a pun: two valid parsings of the same sound field. Composers have used this intuitively (Ravel's stacked thirds create phantom fundamentals; Spectralist composers like Grisey build entire pieces around the ambiguity between harmonic and fundamental). Goodman's framework makes it precise: you can calculate which combinations of notes create false fundamentals, in which register, and of what type.

**Use the bounded search region as a voicing constraint.** The 4 × 4 search region tells you exactly how far apart voices can be before their harmonic series stop interfering. Voicings that keep all notes within this region create maximum harmonic ambiguity (rich, fused timbres); voicings that spread beyond it create clarity and separation. This is a quantitative version of what orchestrators know intuitively about close vs. open voicing.

**Navigate between the grid and its quotients.** A passage that begins in "listener space" (ambiguous fundamentals, fused harmonics, spectral chords) and gradually clarifies into "composer space" (distinct chord progressions, clear voice leading on the Tonnetz) enacts the transition from perception to cognition. This could be a formal principle for a piece: start in the harmonic series, end in functional harmony, with the geometry tracing the path between them.

## What's Missing

The Goodman paper restricts to the first three harmonics, which is a simplification. Real instruments produce many more, with amplitudes that vary by timbre. Extending the framework to higher harmonics would produce larger and more varied shapes, making the decomposition problem harder but the compositional possibilities richer.

The connection to Tymoczko's OPTIC spaces deserves formal treatment. If Goodman's grid really is (a discretization of) the universal cover of OPTIC quotient spaces, there should be explicit covering maps, and the false fundamental classification should have an interpretation in the quotient as some kind of singularity or branch point.

And the big open question from Essay 8 remains: is there a single mathematical framework — perhaps something involving Pontryagin duality on the cylinder, or a fiber bundle structure relating Goodman's cover to Tymoczko's base — that produces *all* the observed dualities as special cases?
