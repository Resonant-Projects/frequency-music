I want to research: [topic, e.g., "Schumann resonance and brainwave entrainment"]

1. Search Google Scholar for recent papers (last 5 years) on this topic
2. Search YouTube for educational videos or lectures
3. Search for any accessible blog posts or articles from researchers

Compile a reading list with:
- 5-10 most relevant papers (title, authors, year, link, whether PDF is accessible)
- 3-5 YouTube videos (title, channel, duration, link)
- Any notable blog posts or articles

Prioritize sources that seem actionable for music composition experiments.
