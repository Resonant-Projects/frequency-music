I'm reading this article: [paste URL]

1. Extract the article using reader mode or by grabbing the main content
2. Create a new page in my Notion "Notes" database with:
   - Title: [article title]
   - Tags: ResonantProjects
   - Source URL: [the URL]
   - Type: article
   - Status: inbox
3. In the page body, paste:
   - A "Summary" section (leave blank for me to fill or write 2-3 sentences)
   - A "Key Quotes" section with any passages I've highlighted (or leave blank)
   - The full article text under a toggle called "Full Text"

Confirm when done and give me the Notion page link.
