I need to download PDFs from these URLs:
[paste your list of paper URLs]

For each one:
1. Navigate to the page
2. Find the PDF download link (check for "Download PDF", "Full Text PDF", or similar)
3. Download to ~/Downloads/ResonantProjects/
4. Rename the file to: AuthorLastName-Year-FirstFewWordsOfTitle.pdf
   (e.g., "Huron-2006-SweetAnticipation.pdf")

If a PDF is paywalled or unavailable, note which ones failed and why.
