I just finished a research session. I have these browser tabs open with
articles/papers I want to capture:

[list the tabs or say "all tabs in this window"]

For each one:
1. Grab the title and URL
2. Determine type (academic paper, blog post, YouTube video, news article)
3. Create a Notion page in my Notes database:
   - Title: [page title]
   - Tags: ResonantProjects
   - Source URL: [URL]
   - Type: [determined type]
   - Status: inbox
4. If it's a PDF, download it to ~/Downloads/ResonantProjects/ with proper naming

Give me a summary of what was captured when done.
